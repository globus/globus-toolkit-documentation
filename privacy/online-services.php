    <h1 class="first">Globus Online Services Privacy Statement</h1>

    <p>Status: CURRENT</p>

<p>The following statement describes data collection, use, and sharing practices 
within the Globus community in regard to use of the Globus community's online 
services (websites, email lists, anonymous FTP server). A 
<a href="software.php">related statement</a> 
covers practices related to data collection, use, and sharing in regard to use of 
Globus software.</p>

<h2>Data We Collect</h2>

<p>The Globus websites (www.globus.org, dev.globus.org, bugzilla.globus.org) and 
our anonymous FTP server collect and log usage data in the normal course of 
operation. The web servers that host these sites collect basic data about the 
browsers used to access them (IP address and any HTTP header data provided by the 
browser). They may use cookies and/or Web beacons to track usage patterns. The 
information collected via these means is used for no purpose other than to track 
and analyze aggregate usage patterns in order to improve the quality of the 
websites and to customize the website experience for users (e.g., remembering the 
contents of fill-out forms for reuse in subsequent forms). Most browsers provide 
options for disabling cookies, and you are free to use these options, though it 
may cause your experience of our websites to be different from users who do not 
use these options.</p>

<p>Note that Globus websites may use the 
<a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> service (provided by 
Google) to track and analyze website usage. The use of Google Analytics involves 
use of a cookie and requires us to share anonymous usage data with Google. For 
Google's privacy policy, click 
<a href="http://www.google.com/privacypolicy.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>Our websites use fill-out forms for requesting information when you engage in 
certain activities. For example, when you download the Globus Toolkit, we request 
data about you. This is also true for our anonymous FTP server. It is your choice 
whether you enter valid data, enter invalid data, or enter no data. We make no 
attempt to validate this data, and you may download the software without 
providing any data, valid or not.</p>

<p>Some of our websites (Bugzilla, the dev.globus Wiki) allow you to register 
your identity by creating a user name and password. In some cases, you will not 
be permitted to take certain actions (enter data, edit content) without 
registering. The registration process may include entering a valid email address, 
and if you do not enter a valid address, your registration will not succeed. Any 
data that you enter when registering with these sites is collected and logged. 
Your user name will typically be visible to others. Some of our websites 
(Bugzilla, the dev.globus Wiki) allow registered users to enter data and/or edit 
content. The data and content that you supply is logged and archived and is 
typically made available for others to view. Even if you remove the data (e.g., 
by editing a Wiki page), the original data is retained and available for review 
by others.</p>

<p>The Globus community uses an extensive set of electronic mailing lists. When 
you subscribe to any of these mailing lists, your email address is stored. If 
you include your full name or any other data when signing up for a mailing 
list, that information is also stored. Any information that you post to a 
Globus mailing list (including header information such as your email address 
and other personal information) will most likely be archived both by Globus and 
by other subscribers and made available for viewing by others. Use of Globus 
software also may result in collection and storage of personal information 
and/or usage data. See the <a href="software.php">Globus Software Privacy 
Statement</a> for details.</p>

<h2>How This Data Is Used</h2>

<p>IP addresses, HTTP header information, cookie and Web beacon data collected 
by Globus websites is logged and used specifically for the purpose of tracking 
and analyzing aggregate usage patterns. We do not attempt to identify or track 
specific users. Usage tracking and analysis is performed in order to help us 
improve the quality and usability of the websites. The data that you provide 
when requested by our web servers (e.g., the Globus Toolkit download form) is 
used to generate reports on the community participation for our own use 
(understanding the community and identifying possible areas for community 
expansion) and--in aggregate form--for use by our sponsors and funders 
toward understanding the impact of their sponsorship. We may identify 
individual users in this data, if you supply the data to enable this.</p>

<p>Data and content that you enter in Bugzilla and the dev.globus Wiki is 
shared publicly with the community.</p>

<p>Email addresses that you enter when subscribing to Globus mailing lists are 
used to distribute messages posted to those lists to you. We may also use 
these addresses to analyze the subscriber base to better understand aggregate 
Globus community participation. We do not share mailing list subscriber lists 
or email addresses with third parties. However, if you post to a Globus mailing 
list, your email address and any other personal information that you include in 
your postings may be stored by other subscribers and used at their discretion.</p>

<p>We may combine IP addresses and email addresses with other sources of 
information (e.g., domain name system (DNS), the whois registry) to assist us 
in analyzing use patterns of our websites and mailing lists.</p>

<p>The web server logs, FTP server logs, and mailing list administrative logs 
are available only to authorized members of the Globus community. Because this 
is a global community, this means that the data will be transported across 
international boundaries.</p>

<h2>Treatment of Spam</h2>

<p>The Globus community is sensitive to the need to avoid unsolicited 
and off-topic messages on our community email lists. The hosting service that 
we use for our email lists has been configured to help in this regard in several 
ways. Most Globus email lists are configured to prevent postings from any address 
that is not subscribed to the list. Such messages are rejected immediately and 
never forwarded to subscribers. All mailing lists are configured to disable 
access to the subscriber list. The email hosting service is also configured to 
evaluate messages for virus and spam content and to flag such messages with 
headers so that email clients can automatically separate them from legitimate 
messages. Due to the global nature of our community, it is impossible to avoid 
all off-topic content on our mailing lists, and automatic rejection of off-topic 
messages is risky. We are constantly reevaluating our strategies for handling 
spam and addressing new spamming techniques.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Statement</h2>

<p>We may occasionally revise the Globus Online Services Privacy Statement. 
Changes to the statement will appear on this page. Please note that our practices 
with respect to data collected and used in connection with this website and all 
other Globus online services are governed by this statement as amended from time 
to time, and not the statement in effect at the time the data was collected.</p>

<h2>How to Contact Us</h2>

<p>The Globus community takes all complaints and concerns regarding privacy 
seriously. Please direct all issues in this area to the email address 
info@globus.org.</p>
