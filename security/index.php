  <p>In conjunction with the release of the Globus Toolkit 4.0, we have 
     restructured our website to improve usability. The information
     formerly at this location has been moved, and this address will be
     phased out soon.  Please use the following address to reach the new
     location.</p>

  <p><a href="<?=$SITE_PATHS["WEB_TOOLKIT"]."docs/4.2/4.2.1/security/"; ?>">http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.2/4.2.1/security/</a></p>

  <p>You may also find the 
     <a href="<?=$SITE_PATHS["WEB_ROOT"]."site_map.php"; ?>">Site Map</a> 
     useful for locating other information on the new website.</p>

  <p>We realize this change is inconvenient. It is our hope that the
     inconvenience will be outweighed by the new site's improved 
     usability.</p>
