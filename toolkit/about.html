          <p>The open source Globus Toolkit &reg; is a fundamental enabling technology

            for the "Grid," letting people share computing power, databases,

            and other tools securely online across corporate, institutional,

            and geographic boundaries without sacrificing local autonomy. The

            toolkit includes software services and libraries for resource monitoring,

            discovery, and management, plus security and file management. In

            addition to being a central part of science and engineering projects

            that total nearly a half-billion dollars internationally, the Globus

            Toolkit is a substrate on which leading IT companies are building

            significant commercial Grid products.</p>

          <p>The toolkit includes software for security, information infrastructure,

            resource management, data management, communication, fault detection,

            and portability. It is packaged as a set of components that

            can be used either independently or together to develop applications.

            Every organization has unique modes of operation, and collaboration

            between multiple organizations is hindered by incompatibility of

            resources such as data archives, computers, and networks. The Globus

            Toolkit was conceived to remove obstacles that prevent seamless collaboration.

            Its core services, interfaces and protocols allow users to access

            remote resources as if they were located within their own machine

            room while simultaneously preserving local control over who can use

            resources and when.</p>

          <p>The Globus Toolkit has grown through an open-source strategy similar

            to the Linux operating system's, and distinct from proprietary attempts

            at resource-sharing software. This encourages broader, more rapid

            adoption and leads to greater technical innovation, as the open-source

            community provides continual enhancements to the product.</p>

          <p>Essential background is contained in the papers "<a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/alliance/publications/papers.php#anatomy">Anatomy

              of the Grid</a>" by Foster, Kesselman and Tuecke and "<a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/alliance/publications/papers.php#OGSA">Physiology

              of the Grid</a>" by Foster, Kesselman, Nick and Tuecke.</p>

          <h2>Acclaim for the Globus Toolkit</h2>

          <p> From version 1.0 in 1998 to the 2.0 release in 2002 and now the

            latest 4.0 version based on new open-standard Grid services, the

            Globus Toolkit has evolved rapidly into what The New York Times called "the

            de facto <a href="news/rd100.html"> <img src="images/rd100.gif" align="right" border="0" height="205" hspace="8" vspace="8" width="200"></a> standard" for

            Grid computing. In 2002 the project earned a prestigious R&amp;D

            100 award, given by R&amp;D Magazine in a ceremony where the Globus

            Toolkit was named "Most Promising New Technology" among the year's

            top 100 innovations. Other honors include project leaders Ian Foster

            of Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago, Carl

            Kesselman of the University of Southern California's Information

            Sciences Institute (ISI), and Steve Tuecke of Argonne being named

            among 2003's top ten innovators by InfoWorld magazine, and a similar

            honor from MIT Technology Review, which named Globus Toolkit-based

            Grid computing one of "Ten Technologies That Will Change the World." The

            Globus Toolkit also won the 2003 Federal Laboratory Consortium award

            for excellence in technology transfer, in recognition of its widespread

            adoption by industry.</p>

          <h2>Genesis of the Globus Project</h2>

          <p> In late 1994 Rick Stevens, director of the mathematics and computer

            science division at Argonne National Laboratory, and Tom DeFanti,

            director of the Electronic Visualization Laboratory at the University

            of Illinois at Chicago, proposed establishing temporary links among

            11 high-speed research networks to create a national grid (the "I-WAY")

            for two weeks before and during the Supercomputing '95 conference.

            A small team led by Ian Foster at Argonne created new protocols that

            allowed I-WAY users to run applications on computers across the country.

            This successful experiment led to funding from the Defense Advanced

            Research Projects Agency (DARPA, and 1997 saw the first version of

            the Globus Toolkit, which was soon deployed across 80 sites worldwide.

            The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) pioneered the application of

            grids to science research, the National Science Foundation (NSF)

            funded creation of the National Technology Grid to connect university

            scientists with high-end computers, and NASA started similar work

            on its Information Power Grid.</p>

          <h2>Widespread Adoption of the Globus Toolkit</h2>

          <p>Grids first emerged in the use of supercomputers, as scientists

            and engineers across the U.S. sought access to scarce high-performance

            computing resources that were concentrated at a few sites. Begun

            in 1996, the Globus Project was initially based at Argonne,

            ISI, and the University of Chicago (U of C). What is now called the

            Globus Alliance has expanded to include the University of Edinburgh,

            the Royal Institute of Technology in Sweden, the National Center

            for Supercomputing Applications, and Univa Corporation. Project participants

            conduct fundamental research and development related to the Grid.

            Sponsors include federal agencies such as DOE, NSF, DARPA, and NASA,

            along with commercial partners such as IBM and Microsoft.</p>

          <p>The project has spurred a revolution in the way science is conducted.

            High-energy physicists designing the Large Hadron Collider at CERN

            are developing Globus-based technologies through the European Data

            Grid, and the U.S. efforts like the Grid Physics Network (GriPhyN)

            and Particle Physics Data Grid. Other large-scale e-science projects

            relying on the Globus Toolkit include the Network for Earthquake

            Engineering and Simulation (NEES), FusionGrid, the Earth System

            Grid (ESG),the NSF Middleware Initiative and

            its GRIDS Center, and the National Virtual Observatory. In addition,

            many universities have deployed campus Grids, and deployments in

            industry are growing rapidly. </p>

          <p>Much as the World Wide Web brought Internet computing onto the average

            user's desktop, the Globus Toolkit is helping to bridge the gap for

            commercial applications of Grid computing. Since 2000, companies

            like Avaki, DataSynapse, Entropia, Fujitsu, Hewlett-Packard, IBM,

            NEC, Oracle, Platform, Sun and United Devices have pursued Grid strategies

            based on the Globus Toolkit. This widespread industry adoption has

            brought a new set of objectives, with the cardinal purpose being

            to preserve the open-source, non-profit community in which the Globus

            Project has thrived, while seeding commercial grids based on open

            standards.</p>

          <p>2004 saw the formation of <a href="http://www.univa.com/">Univa

              Corporation</a>, a company devoted to

            providing commercial support for Globus software, and 2005 the creation

            of the <a href="http://www.globusconsortium.com/">Globus Consortium</a> by a group of companies with an interest

          in supporting Globus Toolkit enhancements for enterprise use. </p>
