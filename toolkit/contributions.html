          <p>The Globus Toolkit is an open source development effort. We encourage

            others to participate in the development of this important body of

            Grid software.</p>

          <h2><a name="Principles"></a>General Principles</h2>

          <p>The goal of these guidelines is to provide mechanisms that enable

            and encourage people to contribute useful and appropriate Grid technologies

            to the Globus Toolkit. By defining well-understood mechanisms and

            soliciting feedback on these mechanisms from the community, we hope

            to ensure that there are benefits both to the contributors and to

            the Grid community as a whole for including new software components

            in the Globus Toolkit.</p>

          <p>The Globus Toolkit is used by hundreds of projects and thousands

            of people worldwide. Our (collective) ability to support this software

            is very important. The standards and expectations presented here

            for software testing, documentation, coding standards, and technical

            support are intended to ensure that the Globus Toolkit is usable

            and supportable for this broadening user community. As this community

            expands, user expectations become higher and it becomes even more

            important to ensure that we continue to meet reasonable expectations

            for the software's quality and reliability.</p>

          <p>Because the Grid community is expanding and now includes for-profit

            and non-profit enterprises, educational institutions and government

            organizations, broad open source licensing is critical. The licensing

            requirements described here are vital to the continued acceptance

            of the Globus Toolkit as a reference implementation for Grid standards.</p>

          <h2>            <a name="Initiate"></a>Initiating the Contribution Process</h2>

          <p>A step-by-step document on the way to initiate the process for contributions

            can be found 

            <a href="GTContributionReviewProcess.pdf">here</a>.</p>

          <h2>            <a name="Licensing"></a>Licensing</h2>

          <p>No one, least of all ourselves, wants to be bothered with legal

            issues, particularly not for open source software! On the other hand,

            our ability to distribute the Globus Toolkit software freely and

            others' ability to use the software without restriction both require

            that we address some legal concerns.</p>

          <p>The central issue is that we must establish clearly our right to

            distribute all contributions, so that neither we nor our users are

            at risk for subsequent legal action. This means that we require contributors

            to establish our legal right to distribute the software without constraint

            by signing one or both of the following license agreements. <!-- <strong>Update:</strong>            These
            licenses have been updated - contributors who have already signed
            the outdated licensing agreement will be requested to sign and submit
            the new one(s).--></p>

          <h2>            <a name="Cobranding"></a>Co-branding</h2>

          <p>Co-branding is an important element in making a software contribution

            to the Globus Toolkit. Co-branding makes it possible for users of

            Globus Toolkit components to recognize both that the software is

            part of the Globus Toolkit and that it has been contributed by a

            specific source, whether that source is the Globus Alliance or some

            other group or individual.</p>

          <p>Globus Toolkit users want to see some visible link between the components

            of the Globus Toolkit. If a component or its documentation bears

            no resemblance to the rest of the Toolkit, the user may doubt whether

            it meets the same standards as the rest of the Toolkit or will work

            well with the rest of the Toolkit. The Globus Toolkit &quot;brand&quot; implies

            certain fundamental characteristics about a piece of software: a

            well-understood style for support, documentation, testing, code quality,

            etc. It would not make sense to contribute a piece of software to

            the Globus Toolkit unless it was desirable to give people the sense

            that the Globus Toolkit brand applies to the software.</p>

          <p>Contributors may also be interested in having users recognize the

            source of their contributed components. Software authors may want

            credit for their work, flexibility in their presentation style for

            documentation or other materials, or other benefits that preclude

            a seamless integration with the Globus Alliance's &quot;look and

            feel&quot;.</p>

          <p>The co-branding mechanisms presented here are intended to provide

            both the benefits of having a contributed component clearly associated

            with the Globus Toolkit and the benefits of maintaining some distinction

            between the people who contributed the components and the Globus

            Alliance.</p>

          <h3>            Credit Given to Contributors</h3>

          <p>The Globus Toolkit is a community effort and we are committed to

            recognizing the contributions of the community: in the code itself,

            in this web site, and elsewhere. In particular, we are committed

            to ensuring that contributors to the Globus Toolkit are credited

            publicly for their contributions.</p>

          <p>One means of accomplishing this is the list of contributors on the

            Globus Alliance website. (See our <a href="contributors.html">list

            of contributors</a>.

            Please let us know if we are missing anyone.)</p>

          <p>Another way is by including documentation about the contributed

            components on the Globus Toolkit website. This documentation may

            be hosted on our site or hosted on a contributor website, but we

            will maintain links to this material and give you mechanisms for

            linking your documentation

            to the rest of the Globus Toolkit. For this reason, it is important

            that contributors provide documentation of their contributions (see

            <a href="#Documentation">Expectations for Documentation</a> below) and also use the Globus Toolkit

            logo and include a statement regarding inclusion in the Globus Toolkit

            in their documentation as described in the following sections.</p>

          <p>Another way that we ensure recognition of contributors is by covering

            contributed components (with appropriate credits) in our Globus Toolkit

            tutorials. We regularly present overviews, developer tutorials, and

            administrator tutorials on the Globus Toolkit to audiences around

            the world. For this reason, it is important that contributors provide

            slides that we can use in our tutorials. (See <a href="#Documentation">Expectations

            for Documentation</a> below.) We have already licensed our tutorial

            presentations for use by others, so you may use our slides in your

            own presentations however you feel it is appropriate.</p>

          <h3>            Using the Globus Toolkit Logo</h3>

          <p>When preparing documentation and other materials (web pages, etc.)

            relating to your contribution, you will find it useful to make a

            visual link to the Globus Toolkit. This assures readers and users

            of your software that it is a part of the Globus Toolkit and is intended

            for use with the other Globus Toolkit components.</p>

          <p>The Globus Alliance logo is not appropriate for this purpose, as

            this logo is only to be used by members of the Globus Alliance. Our

            trademark protects the Globus Alliance logo from unauthorized use,

            and we are obligated to protect this trademark in order to maintain

            its value as a symbol of our group.</p>

          <p>The Globus Toolkit logo has been created specifically for use by

            contributors to the Globus Toolkit to identify their work as a part

            of the Toolkit. We encourage you to use this logo on your documentation

            and any other materials describing your contributions once we have

            agreed to include them in the Globus Toolkit.</p>

          <p>Naturally, we expect that you will also use your own logos, trademarks,

            or other identifying visual information to identify yourself as the

            originators of the work.</p>

          <h3>            Statement of Inclusion in the Globus Toolkit</h3>

          <p>We strongly encourage you to include a statement in your documentation

            that explains that the work has been included in the Globus Toolkit.

            This will clarify for readers that your software is included in the

            Globus Toolkit and is intended for use with other Globus Toolkit

            components. An example of such a statement, which you may feel free

            to use in your work, is included below.</p>

          <blockquote>

            <p> This software [or: &lt;name of product&gt;] is included in the

              Globus Toolkit(R), distributed by the Globus Alliance at <a href="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/">http://www.globus.org/toolkit/</a>.

              Unlimited use is allowed under the terms of a liberal open source

              license.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <h3>Appropriate use of &quot;Globus Alliance&quot; and &quot;Globus

            Toolkit&quot;</h3>

          <p>To avoid confusion among members of our projects and yours and more

            importantly among the user community, proper use of the terms &quot;Globus

            Alliance&quot; and &quot;Globus Toolkit&quot; is vital.</p>

          <p>As a contributor to the Globus Toolkit, you are encouraged to use

            the Globus Toolkit logo and to make statements regarding the inclusion

            of your work in the Globus Toolkit. We will list you as a <a href="contributors.html">contributor</a>            to

            the Globus Toolkit.</p>

          <p>The Globus Alliance is a specific group of people. Members of the

            Globus Alliance are listed on our website at <a href="http://www.globus.org/alliance/team/">http://www.globus.org/alliance/team/</a>.

            If you are not listed on this page, please do not refer to yourself

            as a member of the Globus Alliance. We appreciate your sensitivity

  in this matter.</p>

          <h2>            <a name="CodingStandards"></a>Coding Guidelines</h2>

          <p>The Globus Alliance's coding guidelines for both Java and C are

            documented on the Globus Toolkit website at <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/coding_guidelines.html">http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/coding_guidelines.html</a>.</p>

          <p>As a code contributor, you are not required to adhere to these standards.

            However, there are at least three reasons why you may find it helpful

            to use these standards as a reference when you develop your code.</p>

          <p>The first reason is that most of the code in the Globus Toolkit

            already follows these standards, and users and developers will find

            it easier to follow your code, use it, debug it, and support it if

            you follow similar standards. If your code looks radically different

            from the other code in the Toolkit, it is more likely that users

            and other developers will not use it or will leave it to you to handle

            all of the maintenance and support for the code. If your code looks

            like the rest of the code in the Toolkit, it is likely that others

            will feel more comfortable with it and help you to maintain and support

            it.</p>

          <p>The second reason is that the members of the Globus Alliance will

            be more likely to accept your code as a contribution to the Globus

            Toolkit if you follow the same standards as we have followed, for

            essentially the same reasons as those listed above. We will certainly

            be involved in helping to support and maintain your code once it

            is part of the Globus Toolkit. This will be easier for us if it follows

            the same standards as the rest of the code.</p>

          <p>The third reason is that these standards are useful ones. The standards

            used by the Globus Alliance were developed by talented programmers

            from a broad range of backgrounds. The resulting code has been repeatedly

            cited as an example of high-quality code by users all over the world&mdash;including

            commercial and other professional software development organizations.

            These standards have allowed us to support and maintain a large base

            of code for several years, and new members of our team have found

            the code easy to learn and easy to adapt to new requirements during

            this time.</p>

          <p>Again, there is no requirement for contributed code to use the standards

            documented on our website. Following the standards, however, should

            result in code that is easier for others to use and maintain, more

            likely to be accepted by the Globus Alliance, and higher- quality

            in general.</p>

          <h2>            <a name="Testing"></a>Expectations for Testing</h2>

          <p>Software in the Globus Toolkit is expected to work on a wide range

            of platforms and in a wide range of systems. Testing at several stages

            of the software development and release process is essential to meeting

            this expectation.</p>

          <h3>            Unit Testing</h3>

          <p>We expect that all discrete software components (libraries, service

            executables, tool executables) will have unit tests associated with

            them that ensure their methods and functions work according to some

            set of specifications (which ideally will be documented). These unit

            tests should be run on as many platforms as possible before code

            is contributed to the Globus Toolkit.</p>

          <p>Including these unit tests in the contributed software is a wonderful

            way to help the Globus Alliance ensure that the software works as

            we integrate it into the Globus Toolkit experimental release. This

            will make us much more comfortable with the contribution process

            and possibly speed up release of the contribution. It is also is

            much appreciated by the Globus Toolkit user community, as it gives

            others the tools needed to test ports of the software on new platforms

            and individual builds on any platform. We strongly encourage the

            inclusion of unit tests in the contributed software.</p>

          <h3>            Component-Level Testing</h3>

          <p>In addition to units tests, we expect that component-level tests

            will also be designed, developed, and run prior to contribution to

            the Globus Toolkit.</p>

          <p>For example, if a code contribution includes a library, a client

            tool built on the library, and a service built on the library, one

            component-level test might involve setting up the service with a

            specific configuration and starting state and then running the client

            tool against the service with specific inputs to ensure that the

            client tool and the service both exhibit the expected behavior (output

            data, state changes, log entries, etc.).</p>

          <p>Unlike unit tests, component-level tests may not actually involve

            test code. They can, however, be documented so that others can reproduce

            them. Ideally, a code contribution would include a description of

            reasonable tests to verify that the software is working properly

            once it is built and all unit tests pass.</p>

          <h2>            <a name="Documentation"></a>Expectations for Documentation</h2>

          <p>Documentation is critical for adoption of software by users. Since

            a typical reason for including software in the Globus Toolkit is

            to encourage use by others, documentation is particularly important

            for contributions to the Globus Toolkit.</p>

          <h3>            Specifications for APIs, Protocols, and Services</h3>

          <p>We strongly encourage contributors to document the APIs provided

            by their contributions, the protocols used in their implementations,

            and the services provided (if any). Software included in the Globus

            Toolkit will be used as building blocks for Grid applications and

            Grid infrastructures. These uses require well-documented APIs, protocols,

            and services.</p>

          <p>We recommend that each API, protocol, and service be documented

            separately. (Documents may, of course, reference each other.) Documentation

            should be web- accessible so that it may be linked to from the Globus

            Toolkit website and other Grid resources. The Globus Alliance will

            host your documentation if you do not have access to your own public

            web server.</p>

          <p>The Globus Alliance currently uses the Doxygen system for documenting

            APIs. Doxygen uses a Javadoc markup format within code comments to

            tightly integrate code and its documentation, improving the accuracy

            of the documentation and encouraging updates when code changes. If

            you also use Doxygen or a Javadoc mechanism, your API specifications

            can be automatically generated by Globus Toolkit users.</p>

          <h3>            High-level Documentation</h3>

          <p>High-level documentation&mdash;including user guides, installation

            guides, system administrator guides, etc.&mdash;is also important

            to users of the Globus Toolkit. These guides make it easier for users

            to install, configure, maintain, and use your software components.</p>

          <p>If your components require special instructions for building the

            software, we recommend that you provide written instructions for

            users. If your components include anything other than libraries (command-line

            tools, graphic user interfaces, services), we recommend that you

            provide written instructions for the installation and configuration

            of your software. Members of the Globus Alliance can integrate these

            instructions in to the Globus Toolkit installation guide, administration

            guide, and other resources.</p>

          <h3>            Tutorial Slides</h3>

          <p>Once your contributions are included in the Globus Toolkit, members

            of the Globus Alliance will want to explain these contributions during

            our frequent tutorials and presentations. (See &quot;Co-branding&quot; above,

            specifically &quot;Credit Given to Contributors&quot;.) We strongly

            encourage contributors to provide PowerPoint slides that describe

            their contributions that can be included in the Globus Toolkit tutorials

            and other presentations. Slides describing the design of your contributions

            will be included in overview and developer tutorials. Slides describing

            APIs, protocols, or services will be included in developer tutorials.

            Slides describing the installations and/or configuration of your

            software will be included in administrator tutorials.</p>

          <p>It is important that all components in the Globus Toolkit be covered

            in the Globus Toolkit tutorials. We will certainly provide appropriate

            acknowledgement to contributors in these presentations.</p>

          <h3>            Work with the Latest Code</h3>

          <p>When you are developing your code, please be sure to use the latest &quot;experimental&quot; version

            of the Globus Toolkit. The latest experimental version is the version

            on which the Globus Alliance developers base their new code, and

            it is the version that will eventually become the next &quot;stable

            release&quot; of the Globus Toolkit. The experimental version includes

            the contents of the latest stable release plus any components that

            have been released to the public (as beta releases) since then. Using

            this version during your development helps to ensure that your code

            will work with the next stable release of the Globus Toolkit.</p>

          <p>The latest experimental release of the Globus Toolkit is available

            via anonymous CVS from the Globus Alliance's CVS repository. Please

            refer to the information on the Globus Alliance's website regarding

          <h2>            <a name="Releases"></a>Coordination of Releases</h2>

          <p>The Grid Packaging Technology (GPT) used by the Globus Toolkit allows

            individual components to be packaged and released separately from

            the rest of the Globus Toolkit. When you make a contribution to the

            Globus Toolkit, you will be able to release packages for your components

            that replace or add to existing Globus Toolkit software. The Globus

            Alliance periodically prepares releases of the entire Globus Toolkit

            in order to assign a common version number for use by the community.

            (E.g., Globus Toolkit 2.0, 2.1, 2.2, etc.) These version numbers

            can serve as reference points for people in determining the compatibility

            of their installations or the features supported by their individual

            installations. It is here that coordination among component contributors

            is required.</p>

          <h3>            Globus Toolkit Release Strategy</h3>

          <p>Globus Toolkit releases are provided in pairs. These pairs are always

            released simultaneously and they are initially identical. The two

            releases change in different ways over time. Both releases are available

            via the Globus Alliance anonymous FTP server and linked to from the

            Globus Toolkit download page.</p>

          <ul>

            <li> A stable release is available for people who want a &quot;stable&quot; release,

      with bug fixes provided over time.</li>

            <li> An experimental release is available for people who want the

              latest software, including any beta releases that have been made

              available since the last stable release. </li>

          </ul>

          <p>The stable release is numbered using an even number for the secondary

            version number. The experimental release is numbered with the next

            higher odd number. So stable release 2.4, for example, would be accompanied

            by experimental release 2.5. Again, when these releases are first

            made available, they are identical.</p>

          <p>NOTE: Remote CVS users will always see the experimental release

            unless they use branches or tags to specify a stable release or a

            specific release update.</p>

          <h3>            Release Updates</h3>

          <p>Updates to individual packages within the stable release will be

            provided whenever bug fixes are made. These updates will be listed

            on the Globus Toolkit download page (or a linked page).</p>

          <p>The stable release will be updated periodically via automated processes,

            and these updates (2.0.1, 2.0.2, 2.0.3, etc.) will include any bug

            fixes made since the last stable release update. These updates will

            not include new features, however. These updates will include all

            Globus Toolkit source bundles, but most likely will not include binary

            bundles.</p>

          <p>The experimental release will also be updated periodically via automated

            processes, and these updates (2.1.1, 2.1.2, 2.1.3, etc.) will include

            bug fixes and new features provided by development efforts that have

            reached a beta release point. (Beta releases for occur when a development

            team's work has been finished, all testing is complete, and the code

            is ready to be made available to the public for general use.)</p>

          <h3>            New Releases</h3>

          <p>The stable and experimental releases will remain continue to be

            updated until it is decided by the Globus Alliance team that there

            are enough compelling new features in the experimental release that

            it is time to make a new stable release that contains these features.</p>

          <p>When this occurs, a new set of stable/experimental releases will

            be made available. The contents of both releases will be the same

            as the previous experimental release, and updates will then proceed

            as described above.</p>

          <h3>            Alpha Releases</h3>

          <p>Alpha releases will be provided to specific audiences by individual

            development teams. These alpha releases will contain features from

            a specific development project in progress. Alpha releases will most

            likely be complete releases of the Globus Toolkit (source bundles,

            and perhaps binary bundles).</p>

          <p>It is not recommended that alpha releases be provided as package

            updates to a stable or an experimental release. The automated release

            mechanism will make it very easy to generate a complete release of

            the Globus Toolkit for alpha users, and doing so will greatly simplify

            support for the resulting alpha code. Furthermore, package numbers

            for GPT packages contained in alpha releases will very likely collide

            with package numbers from other alpha, stable, or experimental releases.

            For all of these reasons, it is recommended that alpha releases be

            provided as complete releases and that alpha testers discard these

            releases after testing is complete.</p>

          <h3>            Where do contributors need to get involved?</h3>

          <p>Contributors to the Globus Toolkit will need to be involved at several

            points in the Globus Toolkit release process.</p>

          <p>Contributors may offer alpha releases of their work in progress

            at any time. As described above, these should be complete releases

            of the Globus Toolkit (based on the latest experimental release,

            plus the work in progress). Alpha testers should discard their alpha

            releases when their testing is completed.</p>

          <p>Contributors may be called on to fix bugs, packaging, configuration,

            or installation issues when the Globus Alliance is integrating their

            code into a new experimental release. Since experimental releases

            must be working versions of the Globus Toolkit, if any component

            fails to build, configure, or install correctly, it will interfere

            with the experimental release. The authors of code with such issues

            must address these problems promptly.</p>

          <p>Contributors may also (less frequently) be called on to assist with

            the next stable release following their contribution. This is unlikely

            to happen, since by the time of the stable release, the code will

            already have appeared in experimental releases and all issues should

            have already been identified by users of the experimental releases

            and corrected by the appropriate developers.</p>

          <h2>            <a name="Support"></a>Expectations for Support</h2>

          <p>User support for the Globus Toolkit is provided by the developers

            of each component. By contributing code to the Globus Toolkit, you

            accept responsibility for providing user support, and presumably

            for fixing bugs in your code that are found by users. The Globus

            Alliance is not obligated to provide user support for your code or

            to fix bugs in your code.</p>

          <h3>            Participate in Bugzilla</h3>

          <p>The Globus Alliance's Bugzilla interface allows new bug reports

            and questions to be assigned to anyone registered with the Bugzilla

            system. When you contribute code to the Globus Toolkit, we will begin

            to assign bugs found in your code or questions about your code to

            you or members of your team.</p>

          <p>You must tell us who we should assign bugs and questions regarding

            your code to. You will be responsible for ensuring that these people

            accept bug reports and resolve them by submitting patches, clarifying

            the code or documentation, or answering questions about the code's

            specifications.</p>

          <p>Please note that the Bugzilla system is public. All bug reports

            and questions are visible to the public, and our responses to these

            reports and questions are also public. If it becomes clear that you

            or your assigned staff are not responding to bug reports or questions

            relating to your software, this will be quite visible to the user

            community. In extreme cases, this may result in your code being removed

            from the Globus Toolkit. The Globus Toolkit's user community is quite

            large and is increasingly broad. You will find that the Bugzilla

            system will provide you with considerable feedback regarding your

            software. If you are responsive to bug reports and questions, you

            can be assured that the quality of your code and documentation will

            improve over time as a result of this feedback.</p>
