<p><b><a name="multiplecerts">Q: How does one generate multiple gatekeeper and user
certificates as well as a few&nbsp;LDAP server certificates?</a></b></p>

<p>Write a wrapper script around <code>grid-cert-request</code>, 
to generate a key and a certificate request  (each pair per machine/user can be specified in
a separate file). Then  mail each request separately to the
<code>ca@globus.org</code>. This makes it easy for the
Globus Certificate Authority (CA) to issue certificates and do bookkeeping without too much additional effort.

<p>
 Look at the command line options in grid-cert-request given below:
</p>
 
      <code><pre> %grid-cert-request [-help] [ options ...]

  Options:
    -cn &lt;name&gt;         : Common name of the user
    -gatekeeper &lt;name&gt; : Create certificate for a gatekeeper named &lt;name&gt;
    -host &lt;name&gt;       : Create certificate for a host named &lt;name&gt;
    -dir &lt;dir_name&gt;    : User certificate directory ['/nfs/v5/sridhar/.globus' ]
    -cert &lt;file&gt;       : File name of the certificate
    -key &lt;file&gt;        : File name of the user key
    -req &lt;file&gt;        : File name of the certificate request
    -nopw              : Create certificate without a passwd
    -int[eractive]     : Prompt user for each component of the DN
    -force             : Overwrites prexisting certificates
</pre></code>

<hr>

<p><a name="ldapcert"><b>Q: How do I generate and where do I install the LDAP  server
certificate.&nbsp;
 Also how do I distinguish between the gatekeeper certificate and LDAP
certificate?</b></a></p>
 
<p>
A server certificate is needed by the LDAP service in order to run.
</p>

<p>
To request a server certificate, use the <code>grid-cert-request</code> command:
</p>

      <code><pre>  grid-cert-request -cn ldap/&lt;FQDN&gt; 
                    -cert server.cert -key server.key
                    -req server.request
                    -nopw -dir certdir                    </pre></code>

<p>
  where &lt;<code>FQDN&gt;</code> is the fully qualified domain name of the host
  that will run the LDAP server, <code>server.cert</code> is the required name of
  the server certificate file, <code>server.key</code> is the required name of
  the server key file, <code>server.request</code> is the required name of 
  the server request file,  and <code>certdir</code> is the name of a
  directory in which to store the certificate.
</p>
  The key will be generated immediately and placed in 
  <code>certdir/server.key</code>.
  The key file should be readable only by its owner.&nbsp;
<p>
As seen in the request above, the LDAP server certificate will have &quot;ldap&quot; in the message.</p>

<p><a name="mdssecuritymodel"><b>Q: What is the security model
for MDS 2.1?</b></a></p>

<p>MDS 2.1 uses OpenLDAP, which is based on LDAPv3. The security in
OpenLDAP (as
of version 2.0) is
provided by SASL, which uses GSSAPI.</p>
<p>      GSSAPI is a convenient generic interface for secure application development.
By itself, GSSAPI does not provide any security. It relies on underlying technologies to provide the actual identity authentication and message
protection services desired by applications communicating over a network. Such a security technology is called a GSSAPI security mechanism.
Applications may install and request the use of particular mechanisms or use a default mechanism provided by the GSSAPI implementation.</p>

<p>      The GSSAPI security mechanism developed for MDS 2.1 is GSI, which
enables the use of Globus certificates and grid-map files to provide
authorization services to information objects. At the present time, we have
all-or-nothing authorization, depending on whether an entry exists in a grid-mapfile.
However, with the incorporation of CAS (Community Authorization Service), we
will soon be able to provide a fine-grained access control to objects.</p>

<p>      A security mechanism is identified by a globally unique Object Identifier
(OID). For example, the OID for GSI is 1.3.6.1.4.1.3536.1.1.</p>

<p>      The main security enhancement to LDAPv3 (in comparison to LDAPv2) is that new authentication mechanisms have been added to the bind
operation: password protection using a hash function, and certificate-based digitally
signed token. These are fully compatible with the definitions found in X.509, so that an LDAP to X.500 gateway can pass them directly to the      X.500 server. The protocol is extensible to allow for
privately defined or future additional authentication      mechanisms, including challenge-response and multi-stage binds, and the server can return credentials to the      client.<br>
<br>
      A problem with LDAPv2 deployment was that the string syntaxes for certificates and certificate revocation lists
(CRLs) were not reversible, and that it was not always possible to obtain the DER binary encoding of values
with      these syntaxes in order to be able verify signatures. In contrast, LDAPv3
clients can request to receive CRLs,      certificates and distinguished names in binary (DER encoded ASN.1) form, which eliminates the ambiguity.&nbsp;</p>


<hr>

<p><a name="rootaccess"><b>Q: Do I need root access to install and run MDS
2.1?</b></a></p>

<p>Root access is needed if you want to set up MDS 2.1 to automatically start
up at system boot time. This can also be requested of system staff.</p>


<hr>

<p><b><a name="bindlocalerror">Q: I have everything up and running, but when I try to do a 
grid-info-search I get an error message:</a>

<blockquote>ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: local error</blockquote>

What's wrong?</b>
</p>

 
<p>In MDS 2.1, clients perform a GSI-GSSAPI bind to the MDS server. 
The error message seen above occurs if the client does not have a valid proxy, or: <code><pre>$ ./install/openldap/bin/ldapsearch -h 1linux -p 2167 -s sub -b
&quot;o=Grid&quot; &quot;objectclass=*&quot;

SASL/GSSAPI authentication started

ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: Local error
</pre></code>

<p>If the &quot;-x&quot; option is used, we get the following:</p>

	<code><pre>$ ./install/openldap/bin/ldapsearch -h 1linux -p 2167 -s sub -b &quot;o-Grid&quot;
&quot;objectclass=*&quot; -x

version:2

#
# Filter: objectclass=*
# requesting: ALL
#

# search result
search: 2
result: 53 DSA is unwilling to perform
text: access denied: gridmap lookup failed

# numResponses: 1
</pre></code>

<p>This occurs whether we turn anonymous bind on or off, and whether we have run
grid-proxy-init or not. Also, the grid-mapfile, owned by root, contains:</p>

	<code><pre>&quot;/C=US/O=UNIV/L=COMP/CN=John Doe/Email=john.doe@comp.univ.edu&quot;
globus</pre></code>

<p>In the file 
/opt/globus-mds/share/certificates/ca-signing-policy.conf, 
both Globus and the UNIV CA appear.</p>

<p><b>What could the problem be?</b></p>



<p>The failure is happening at 'bind' time; the check on gridmap occurs at the
backend, after the bind goes through.</p>

<p>Usually GIIS servers are started as user globus
and clients are users. The
gridmap file should include the user's DN and their 
local account name. The gridmap should contain entries for users only. No entry for user
globus is needed. 

<p>The globus account does
not need to do a grid-proxy-init. 
In fact, make sure that there isn't an old
proxy in /tmp that belongs to 
globus. 

<p>
Regular user accounts need to have a valid proxy, 
which can be obtained using grid-proxy-init. 

<p>
To check if a proxy is still valid, use
grid-proxy-info. 
Make sure that the user's X509_USER_PROXY
 is pointing to a valid proxy.</p>
 
<p>If you are testing with ldapsearch, you need to supply the 
"-Y GSSAPI"
parameter to force it to use 
GSI-GSSAPI.
<p>
    If the server certificates are owned by root, then the 
    server must be started as root. If the server will be started as globus, 
    then the server certificates must be owned by globus.</p>

<p><b>
    <a name="gridcertrequestsamemachine">Q: Do I need to run 
    grid-cert-request on the same machine as MDS 2.1?</a></b></p>
<p>
  No. The syntax for grid-cert-request is:</p>
<pre>grid-cert-request -cn ldap/&lt;FQDN&gt; 
                  -cert servercert.pem -key serverkey.pem
                  -req serverkey.pem
                  -nopw -dir certdir
</pre>

<p>
This can be executed anywhere, on any machine. The <code>-dir</code> 
can be local to that
machine, or on an accessible remote machine. Once received, the certificate can
be moved to a new location. The <code>FQDN</code> must be the
fully qualified domain
name of the machine that MDS 2.1 server will be running on. The certificate
authority does not require that the certificate request for machine A must come from machine A.</p>

<p><b><br>
  <a name="anonymousqueriesonly">
  Q: I downloaded the Globus Toolkit 2.0 release and installed MDS.&nbsp;
  All of the installation was successful.<br>
  <br>
  I applied the ldap server certification, and I put servercert.pem and
  serverkey.pem in GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc.<br>
  <br>
  Then I started MDS with the SXXgris start
  command.<br>
  <br>
  I could do anonymous (anonymous flag set; without SASL) queries, as
  follows:<br>
  <br>
  grid-info-search -x -b &quot;mds-vo-name=local, o=grid&quot;<br>
  grid-info-search -x -b &quot;mds-vo-name=site, o=grid&quot;<br>
  <br>
  But I could not do security-enabled (with SASL) queries, as follows:<br>
  <br>
  % grid-info-search -b &quot;mds-vo-name=local, o=grid&quot;
  ldap_sasl_interactive_bind_s: No such attribute</a> </b><br>
  <br>
  Usually if anonymous queries work but authenticated queries do not, it means the server
  is
  up and running.<br>
  <br>
  The problem could be that the wrong server port is being used, i.e., the
  port is not set up for authentication, or that there are no certificates
  in the certificate directory.<br>
  <br>
  First, make sure the client has a valid proxy to start with, and second,
  that the server certificate permission is correct.&nbsp;
  The key is probably not world-readable or writable.&nbsp; You can look into ~globus/.globus.&nbsp; There are several sets of server certificates that have the
        right permission to run the server as 'globus'.<br>
  <br>
  If all seems to be correct, find 

  ldapsearch
  and make calls like:<br>
  <br>

  ldapsearch -x&nbsp; -s base -h
        their-host -p their-port -b &quot;&quot;<br>
  supportedsaslmechanisms<br>
  <br>
  on the server to see if the mechanism is correct.<br>
  <br>
  Sometimes, it might be because 

  SASL_PATH
  is not set properly, so client and server cannot find the SASL plug-ins.&nbsp;
  If 

  -d 255
  is put on the ldapsearch
  call, it will give a lot more debugging information and can eliminate some other
  missteps.<br>

<p><b><a name="configchangesdonottakeeffect">Q:
      I’ve made configuration changes to my MDS setup, but they do not take effect when I start MDS.</a> </b><br>
  <br>
 
  You or someone else may have a slapd server from a previous startup of MDS already running on the system, preventing a new slapd from starting.  For example, you and another user may both be trying to run slapd servers on the same port.  Or there may be a slapd running from a previous version or installation of MDS.<br>
  <br>
  This situation may also cause the slapd server to not start at all when you enter the

  SXXgris
start

  command to invoke MDS.  However, there may be other reasons for the slapd server not starting, such as not setting or sourcing your environment, not having the right certificates, and so forth.  Refer to the
  <a href="mdsusersguide.pdf">MDS 2.1 User’s Guide</a> for more information on those topics.<br>
  <br>
Check your environment for the slapd servers that are currently running.  To see which slapd servers are currently running on Linux, enter the following command:</p>
<pre>  % ps uawx | grep slapd</pre>
<p>  From the output of this command, you can see if any old or conflicting slapd
  servers are running, and you can remove them as appropriate with the kill
  command.<br>
  <br>
  Note that the SXXgris stop command may not kill the slapd instance you had
  intended. Use the kill command instead.
  SXXgris stop is appropriate for when you want to stop MDS, make a configuration
  change, and restart MDS via SXXgris start, assuming there are no conflicting
  slapd servers running at that point in time. </p>

  In the SXXgris file in $GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin, there is a call to grid-info-soft-register, with a parameter "-d 0".  You can change this to, for example, “-d 255” to get lots of debugging information.<br>

  queries.</a></b><br>
  <br>
  Assuming everything else is in fact set up properly, the problem may have 
  to do with how the host names of the machines are being reported. When a 
  host name is looked up on a machine without that host name in its 
  /etc/hosts file, it is looked up through DNS and returns the correct 
  result. If the machine does have a host name in its /etc/hosts file but 
  the host name is not in fully qualified format, or is in that format but 
  does not appear first on the line referencing it, it fails to resolve 
  correctly and the Globus Toolkit is not able to authenticate its 
  certificate.<br>
  <br>
  For example, a hosts file appearing like this will not allow authenticated 
  access because the fully qualified name appears second on each line:<br>
  <br>
  122.0.0.1 host01 host01.univ.edu localhost<br>
  125.213.49.87 host01 host01.univ.edu<br>
  <br>
  A hosts file appearing like this will allow authenticated access because 
  the fully qualified name appears first on each line:<br>
  <br>
  122.0.0.1 host01.univ.edu host01 localhost<br>
  125.213.49.87 host01.univ.edu host01<br>
