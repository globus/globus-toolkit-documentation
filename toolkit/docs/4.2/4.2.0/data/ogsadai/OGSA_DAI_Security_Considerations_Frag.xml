    <title>OGSA-DAI Security Considerations</title>
    <para>OGSA-DAI does not provide any security over and above that already provided by the Globus
        Toolkit. However, consideration must be given to the role mapping which converts a grid
        credential to a database username/password. OGSA-DAI comes with two basic role mappers: a
        simple role mapper which accesses a plain text file with this information and one which
        encrypts the username/password information. More details can be found in the documentation
        bundled with the documentation. If neither of these schemes are secure enough then it is
        possible to replace it by implementing a new role mapper interface.</para>
