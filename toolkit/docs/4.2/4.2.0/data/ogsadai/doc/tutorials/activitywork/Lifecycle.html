<h1>The Life-cycle of an Activity During Execution of a Perform Document</h1>
<p>
The engine defines three distinct phases in the life cycle of an
activity's life cycle. These phases map directly onto methods defined
in the <span class="java">uk.org.ogsadai.engine.Activity</span> base 
class which activity implementations must sub-class:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<a href="#Construction">Construction</a>  - <span
class="java">Activity(org.w3c.dom.Element)</span>. 
</li>
<li>
<a href="#Initialisation">Initialisation</a> - <span
class="java">setContext(uk.org.ogsadai.common.Context)</span>.
</li>
<li>
<a href="#ProcessingOutput">Processing and Output</a> - <span
class="java">processBlock()</span>. 
</li>
</ol>
<p>
When a Perform document is received by an OGSA-DAI service it is
forwarded directly on to the engine for processing. This is done as
follows:  
</p>
<ol>
<li>
The document is validated against the XML Schema describing valid 
Perform documents.
</li>
<li>
Any invocation context, such as the client's distinguished name
and message context, is added to the execution context.  
</li>
<li>
For each activity in the Perform document, an
instance of the associated activity class (defined by an activity
mapping in an activity configuration document) is created using the
contents of the element.  
</li>
<li>
The execution context is prepared:
<ol>
<li>
Pipes are created for inputs and/or outputs published by activities
and are placed in the context. 
</li>
<li>
A dependency check is done to ensure that all inputs required by
activities are present.
</li>
<li>
Additional configuration of the context is performed. 
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
The instantiated activities are provided with the 
context within which they will execute.  
</li>
<li>
The engine executes the client's request. 
</li>
<li>
Either the results from the execution are delivered to the
client, or the status of the request if the results are being
delivered elsewhere.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
If any of these steps fail then an error is returned to the client
detailing what occurred and any subsequent processing of the request
is terminated immediately. Any/all data produced by the request
that has not yet been delivered is discarded.
</p>
<p>
The execution strategy used is an extremely simple pull mechanism - if 
an activity does not define any outputs the 
engine will repeatedly call the <span
class="java">processBlock</span> method of that activity. This will
cause each activity in the dependency chain to have <span
class="java">processBlock</span> called on it as its consumer's
request blocks its execution. There is a mechanism provided for
pre-caching and buffering blocks between activities but the basic
implementation does not provide the necessary logic to select if this
should occur. 
</p>

<h2 id="Construction">Construction</h2>
<pre class="java">
public Activity(org.w3c.dom.Element)
</pre>
<p>
An activity is constructed using <span
class="java">org.w3c.dom.Element</span> passed into their
constructor. This element will be extracted from a Perform document
and will conform to the XML Schema associated with the activity via
an activity mapping. 
</p>
<p>
For most activities this <span class="java">Element</span> will
contain two distinct parts. One 
part is configuration information that is activity-specific, e.g. the
public key a <span class="java">PGPEncryption</span>  activity should
use. The other part supplies the names of the inputs and outputs for
the activity. The XML Schema for the activity defines inputs that the
activity can take and outputs that it can provide, but the names for
both inputs and outputs are defined per request and so are provided
within an each activity's element in a Perform document. These
names are extracted by the engine and are required to permit
construction of the pipes that link activities 
together. Publishing of inputs/outputs for use by the 
engine is done by putting the names of
inputs and outputs into two <span class="java">String</span> arrays,
<span class="java">mInputs</span> and <span
class="java">mOutputs</span> respectively, e.g.:  
</p>
<pre class="java">
mInputs = new String[] { input };
</pre>
<p>
The constructors of activities are permitted to throw two types of
exceptions, both of which are relayed by the
engine back to the user.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span class="java">ActivitySystemException</span>:
Indicates an exception which arises due to an implementation fault or
an unrecoverable error which occurred due to circumstances beyond the
user's control (e.g. a network connection unexpectedly failing).
</li>
<li>
<span class="java">ActivityUserException</span>:
Indicates an exception which arises due to a parameter the user supplied
being invalid (e.g. a syntax error in an SQL command).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Non-OGSA-DAI exceptions which are thrown as a result of the logic contained
within an activity's constructor should be wrapped up in either of the above
types of exception, rather than being thrown from the constructor themselves.
Special care should be taken to ensure that all <span class="java">java.lang.RuntimeException</span>s are caught and re-packaged in an <span class="java">ActivitySystemException</span> or an <span class="java">ActivityUserException</span>.
</p>
 
<h2 id="Initialisation">Initialisation</h2>
<!-- TODO I think this is out of date. How about discussing the initialise() method? -->
<pre class="java">
public void setContext(org.uk.ogsadai.common.Context)
</pre>
<p>
Initialisation of an activity prior to executing a request is done
via a call to the activity's <span
class="java">setContext(Context)</span> method. This state occurs once 
the entire request has been pre-processed successfully.
</p>
<p>
Each of the activities in the request is initialised with the 
context to be used during execution. Within
the <span class="java">setContext</span> method the 
context should be considered  read-only
by the activity. This is stipulated to maintain the consistency of the
context across all the activities
involved in the request (there is no guaranteed initialisation order
for activities so it is not possible to predict the behaviour
resulting from altering the context at this
point). If an activity must be able to modify the context it should be
done by overriding the 
<span class="java">configureContext(Context)</span> method.
</p>
<p>
The usual behaviour of an activity during initialisation is for it to
retrieve its inputs and outputs (<span
class="java">BlockReader</span>s and <span
class="java">BlockWriter</span>s respectively) from the 
context and store them within the activity for
easy access during the processing/output phase. During initialisation
an activity must not attempt to read from or write to any of the
inputs and outputs provided in the context during initialisation.   
</p>

<h2 id="ProcessingOutput">Processing and Output</h2>
<p>
The activity design is based on a model where activities operate on
blocks of data provided via a stream. An activity is thus expected to
operate in an iterative fashion, the simplest case being where it
pulls a block of data from an input, does some processing on the block
and then publishes the result via its outputs for use by another
activity. As a result, processing and output are considered to be one
stage in an activity's life cycle because the two are inextricably
linked in the model. 
</p>
<p>
This maps directly onto the <span class="java">processBlock()</span>
method. This method is called on an activity by the engine when the 
activity is required to do some processing. While it is not necessary
for an activity to output a block as a result of every call to <span 
class="java">processBlock()</span> that is nevertheless the expected
behaviour (activities that provide no outputs are a special case). The
method will continue to be called until a block has been output. For
activities with more than one output the method will be called until a
block has been written to the output that triggered the call.
</p>
<p>
If an error occurs within the logic of the
<span class="java">processBlock()</span> method which needs to be
brought to the users attention, this can be achieved by the use of the
<span class="java">setError(ActivityException)</span> method. This causes
processing of the activity to cease, so that the
<span class="java">processBlock()</span> method is not called again,
and provides the user with the details of the error which occurred. Note
that it is not permitted to raise an exception other than one which
is a sub-type of <span class="java">ActivityException</span>, so all
other exceptions must be wrapped in either an
<span class="java">ActivitySystemException</span> or an
<span class="java">ActivityUserException</span>, as appropriate, along
with an adequate description of why the exception occurred.
