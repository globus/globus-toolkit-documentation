 <para>The standalone Java WS Core container can be started and stopped with the provided <olink targetdoc="javawscoreDeveloper"
  targetptr="globus-start-container"/> and <olink targetdoc="javawscoreDeveloper" targetptr="globus-stop-container"/> programs.
  There are also helper programs (available only with the full GT installation) to start and stop
  the container detached from the controlling terminal (<olink targetdoc="javawscoreDeveloper"
   targetptr="globus-start-container-detached"/> and <olink targetdoc="javawscoreDeveloper"
   targetptr="globus-stop-container-detached"/>). </para>

  <title>Deploying and undeploying services</title>
  <para> To deploy a service into Java WS Core container use the <olink targetdoc="javawscoreDeveloper" targetptr="deployGar"/>
   tool. To undeploy a service use <olink targetdoc="javawscoreDeveloper" targetptr="undeployGar"/>. </para>

  <title>Recommended JVM settings for the Java WS Core container</title>
  <para> It is recommended to increase the maximum heap size of the JVM when running the container.
   By default on Sun JVMs a 64MB maximum heap size is used. The maximum heap size can be set using
   the <computeroutput>-Xmx</computeroutput> JVM option. Example: </para>
  <screen>$ setenv GLOBUS_OPTIONS -Xmx512M 
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/globus-start-container</screen>
  <para> The above example will make the container start with maximum heap size set to 512MB. </para>
  <para> It is also recommended to experiment with other JVM settings to improve performance. For
   example, the <computeroutput>-server</computeroutput> option on Sun JVMs enables a server VM
   which can deliver better performance for server applications. </para>
