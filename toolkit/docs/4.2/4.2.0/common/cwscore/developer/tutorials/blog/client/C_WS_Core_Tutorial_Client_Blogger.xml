<section id="cwscore-tutorial-client-Intro"><title>Introduction: A Blog Service</title>
<para>
The Globus Toolkit C WS-Core codebase provides tools and APIs for interacting 
with web services from a client written in C.  It provides additional support 
for interacting with resource enabled (WSRF) web services.
This tutorial provides a walkthrough of the steps 
to take to create such a C client.
</para><para>
The client we implement interacts with the BlogService, which is a simple 
 example of a Blog web service.  See the 
<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=weblog">
Wikipedia entry on Blogs</ulink> for more information on Blogging.

In our simple example, the topic for each Blog is maintained as a
<emphasis>WS-Resource</emphasis>.  The primary ResourceProperty type associated
with each Blog resource is an array of strings 
of all the entries made to that blog topic.  
</para>

<para>
Clients can create new Blog
resources with the <emphasis>createBlogTopic</emphasis> factory operation, and
append their own entries to that resource with the <emphasis>addEntry</emphasis>
operation.  Because the blog stores the entries beyond the lifetime
of a single web service invocation (such as <emphasis>addEntry</emphasis>), 
maintaining each blog topic as a resource is a natural use of the framework.
</para>
<para>
The public interface to a Blog's entry strings is through
the <emphasis>resource property</emphasis> named <computeroutput>BlogEntry</computeroutput>, 
and the resource property operations (i.e. <emphasis>GetResourceProperty</emphasis>)
that are inherited by the BlogService.
</para>
<para>
The tutorial walks through creation of a blog resource, invoking the
<emphasis>addEntry</emphasis> operation on that resource, accessing
the blog's entries, and finally destroying the blog resource.
</para>

See: <olink targetdoc="cwscoreDeveloper" targetptr="cwscore-developer-tutorials-Service"/> for further information on
the service side of the implementation.  Here, we provide
the steps for creating the C client:
</para>

</section>

<section id="cwscore-tutorial-client-Step0" xreflabel="Step 0: Acquire a WSDL schema"><title>Step 0: Acquire a WSDL schema</title>
<para>This is the first step to writing your own client.  You must
either obtain a pre-existing WSDL schema file (or files), or
you must write your own.  If you are just going to write
a client that interacts with a pre-existing service, the WSDL
schema for that service already exists, and you should be able
to obtain it from the service author.
</para>
<para>
    For the BlogService, we provide <ulink url="../blog.wsdl">blog.wsdl</ulink>
that defines
the factory operation <computeroutput>createBlogTopic</computeroutput>, 
the append operation <computeroutput>addEntry</computeroutput>, and the
<computeroutput>BlogEntry</computeroutput> resource property for each blog resource.  The WSDL schema files should be installed somewhere in the $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/schema tree.  In the case of the blog WSDL, you need to install them into $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/schema/tutorials/blog/.  This allows the relative paths in the schema import declarations to work.
 </para>
</section>

<section id="cwscore-tutorial-client-Step1" xreflabel="Step 1: Generate Client Bindings"><title>Step 1: Generate Client Bindings</title>
<para>Once you have the WSDL schema(s) for the service, you
need to generate the client bindings from that schema.  This
will provide the C types and functions (bindings) you need
to use to interact with the service.  The command used to generate
the bindings is <computeroutput>globus-wsrf-cgen</computeroutput>.
</para>
<para>
To run this command on the blog
schema files, they must be placed in 
<computeroutput>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/schema/tutorials/blog/</computeroutput>,
as described in Step 0.
The command for generating the blog client bindings looks like this:
<screen>
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/globus-wsrf-cgen -no-service -s blog_client \
    -flavor &lt;flavor&gt; -d $PWD/bindings \
    $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/schema/tutorials/blog/blog_service.wsdl
</screen>
This command will generate the GPT package listed above.  The package
can be built and installed using the following command:
<screen>
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-build bindings/blog_client_bindings-0.2.tar.gz &lt;flavor&gt;
</screen>
</para>
</section>



<section id="cwscore-tutorial-client-Step2" xreflabel="Step 2: Write the Client"><title>Step 2: Write the Client</title>
<para>In order to write a C WS-Core client, the following steps should
be followed in general:
</para>

    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-client-Header" xreflabel="Include the Client Header"><title>Include the Client Header</title>
<para>
The client bindings generated from <olink targetdoc="cwscoreDeveloper" targetptr="cwscore-tutorial-client-Step1" /> include a client header
which provides the necessary function
declarations to perform the client invocations we need to make.
In the case of the BlogService, the 
    <ulink url="BlogService_client.h">BlogService_client.h</ulink> is
the header we need, so it gets included at the top of the file:
<screen>
#include "BlogService_client.h"
</screen>
</para>
</section>

    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-client-Activation" xreflabel="Module Activation"><title>Module Activation</title>
<para>
The first step of the client is to activate the module defined
for the client.  Module activation is a pattern used frequently
in the Globus Toolkit.  It provides initialization and setup for
a particular library, and the libraries it depends on.  In this case,
the module we are activating is the <computeroutput>BLOGSERVICE_MODULE</computeroutput>,
defined in 
    <ulink url="BlogService_client.h"><computeroutput>BlogService_client.h</computeroutput></ulink>,
as follows:
<screen>
globus_module_activate(BLOGSERVICE_MODULE);
</screen>
</para>
</section>

    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-client-Handle" xreflabel="Client Handle Init"><title>Client Handle Init</title>
<para>Once the module is activated, the client handle must be initialized:
<screen>
BlogService_client_handle_t  blog_handle;

...

result = BlogService_client_init(
    &amp;blog_handle,
    NULL, NULL);
</screen>
This handle provides abstraction for messaging and transport configuration
parameters, and is used by all Blog service invocations.  The
second and third parameters are attrs and handler chains that determine
how the message is serialized and transported.  In this example, we use
the default configuration, so the parameters are <computeroutput>NULL</computeroutput>.
</para>
<para>
In some scenarios, attrs and handlers will need to be setup explicitly
by the user. 
</para>
</section>

    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-client-Resource" xreflabel="Creating a Resource"><title>Creating a Resource</title>
<para>Once the client handle is initialized, the next step is to create the
    blog resource in the BlogService.  The <ulink url="create_blog.c">create_blog.c</ulink>
performs resource creation by invoking the <emphasis>createBlogTopic</emphasis> factory
operation.  The bindings call
from the client looks like this:
<screen>

    createBlogTopicType                 createBlogTopic;
    createBlogTopicResponseType *       createBlogTopicResponse;
    Blog_createBlogTopic_fault_t        create_fault_type;
    xsd_any *                           fault;

    ...

    createBlogTopic.Topic = "Emacs vs. vi: Which is better?";
    createBlogTopic.Creator = "slang";

    result = Blog_createBlogTopic(
        blog_handle,
        "http://the.service.host:8080/wsrf/services/BlogService",
        &amp;createBlogTopic,
        &amp;createBlogTopicResponse,
        &amp;create_fault_type,
        &amp;fault);
</screen>
This is a code of the createBlogTopic invocation, similar to
    what's in the <ulink url="create_blog.c">create_blog.c</ulink>
example.
The <computeroutput>Blog_createBlogTopic</computeroutput> function is defined
    in <ulink url="BlogService_client.h">BlogService_client.h</ulink>.  The
parameters are the initialized blog handle, the endpoint URI to the
BlogService 
(i.e. <emphasis>"http://the.service.host:8080/wsrf/services/BlogService"</emphasis>),
the input and output parameters, and the fault parameters.  In this
particular example, the <computeroutput>createBlogTopic</computeroutput> input parameter
holds the topic for the blog, and the creator of the blog.
The <computeroutput>createBlogTopicResponse</computeroutput> output parameter is
filled in by the function call, with the EndpointReference of the resource
created by the <emphasis>createBlogTopic</emphasis> invocation.
In our example code, we export the EndpointFeference to a file, which
allows us to access it after the createBlogTopic process has completed.
<screen>
    globus_soap_message_handle_t        epr_out_handle;

...

    result = globus_soap_message_handle_init_to_file(
        &amp;epr_out_handle,
        "emacs_vi_epr.xml",
        GLOBUS_XIO_FILE_CREAT);

...

    result = wsa_EndpointReferenceType_serialize(
        &amp;BlogEPR_qname,
        &amp;createBlogTopicResponse->EndpointReference,
        epr_out_handle,
        0);
...

    globus_soap_message_handle_destroy(epr_out_handle);

</screen>
Now we must destroy the response from <emphasis>createBlogTopic</emphasis> invocation:
<screen>
createBlogTopicResponse_destroy(createBlogTopicResponse);
</screen>
</para>
</section>

    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-client-Invoke" xreflabel="Invoking a Resource Operation"><title>Invoking a Resource Operation</title>
<para>Once the EndpointReference has been written to file, we have
a reference to the blog resource, so we can call the
<computeroutput>addEntry</computeroutput> operation on that resource from another process.
    This is what the <ulink url="add_blog_entry.c">add_blog_entry.c</ulink>
client example does.  The EndpointReference for the blog resource
is first imported from the file:
<screen>
    globus_soap_message_handle_t        epr_in_handle;

...

    result = globus_soap_message_handle_init_from_file(
        &amp;epr_in_handle,
        "emacs_vi_epr.xml");

...

    result = wsa_EndpointReferenceType_init(&amp;blog_resource_reference);

...

    result = wsa_EndpointReferenceType_deserialize(
        &amp;BlogEPR_qname,
        blog_resource_reference,
        epr_in_handle,
        0);

...

    globus_soap_message_handle_destroy(epr_in_handle);
</screen>

Once the EndpointReference is imported, the addEntry operation 
is invoked as follows:
<screen>
    addEntryType                      entry;
    addEntryResponseType *            blog_entries;

    Blog_addEntry_fault_t             add_fault_type;
    xsd_any *                           fault;

    entry.Comment = "What's vi??";
    entry.Author = "EmacsPowerUser";

    result = Blog_addEntry_epr(
        blog_handle,
        blog_resource_reference,
        &amp;entry,
        &amp;blog_entries,
        &amp;add_fault_type,
        &amp;fault);
</screen>

For this invocation, we're using the 
<computeroutput>Blog_addEntry_epr</computeroutput> function 
(instead of <computeroutput>Blog_addEntry</computeroutput>).
This allows us to pass in the EndpointReference of the resource directly 
as the second parameter (that's why the function ends in <computeroutput>_epr</computeroutput>).  
The first parameter is the client handle,
The third and fourth parameters are the input and output parameters to the
operation (the blog entry to add, and the resulting entries on the blog),
followed by the fault parameters.  Once this function call returns 
successfully, the <computeroutput>addEntryResponse</computeroutput> parameter will contain
all the entries made to the blog.
This call can be made subsequently and entries will continue to be appended
to the resource.

Once the response is no longer needed after a call to
<computeroutput>Blog_addEntry_epr</computeroutput>, we must destroy it:
<screen>
xsd_string_destroy(addEntryResponse);
</screen>

The output of running <computeroutput>add-blog-entry</computeroutput> 
will look something like this:
<screen>
./add-blog-entry emacs_vi_blog.xml "Emacs rocks!" anonymous

</para>
</section>

    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-client-GetRP" xreflabel="Getting a Resource Property Value"><title>Getting a Resource Property Value</title>
<para>The WSDL schema for the BlogService defines a Resource Property 
<emphasis>BlogEntry</emphasis> as part of the
resource property document for the Blog port type.  This resource property
allows us to access the state of the resource (get the entries) with the 
<computeroutput>GetResourceProperty</computeroutput> operation defined in the WS-ResourceProperties
schema and inherited by the Blog portType.  The 
    <ulink url="get_blog_entries.c">get_blog_entries.c</ulink> client example performs
this operation on the Blog resource.
The invocation is made as follows:
<screen>
#include "BlogEntry.h"

...

    wsrp_GetResourcePropertyResponseType *      RPResponse;
    Blog_GetResourceProperty_fault_t            getrp_fault_type;
    xsd_any *                                   fault;

    ...

    result = Blog_GetResourceProperty_epr(
        blog_handle,
        blog_resource_reference,
        &amp;BlogEntry_qname,
        &amp;RPResponse,
        &amp;getrp_fault_type,
        &amp;fault);
</screen>
In this function call, the client handle and endpoint reference are
passed as the first two parameters.  The third parameter (the operation
input) is the qualified name of the Resource Property.  In this case,
the QName is declared in the generated header <emphasis>BlogEntry.h</emphasis> as the global
variable <computeroutput>BlogEntry_qname</computeroutput>.  The output parameter 
<computeroutput>RPResponse</computeroutput> is the response from 
the <computeroutput>GetResourceProperty</computeroutput> operation.  On successful
completion of the function, this response parameter will contain
the value(s) of the ResourceProperty.  Because resource properties
can have any type, the response is deserialized as an array of
<computeroutput>xsd_any *</computeroutput> instances.  In order to access the actual
value from this structure, the type of the <computeroutput>xsd_any *</computeroutput>
instance must be verified to match the expected type:
<screen>
    if(RPResponse->any.elements[i].any_info->type !=
       (&amp;BlogEntry_qname) &amp;&amp;
       (RPResponse->any.elements[i].any_info->type !=
       (&amp;Blog_BlogEntry_rp_qname))
    {
        /* error!  Unexpected type */
    }
</screen>
What's happening here?  The <computeroutput>wsrp_GetResourcePropertyResponseType</computeroutput> 
structure contains
the field <computeroutput>any</computeroutput>, which is an <computeroutput>xsd_any_array</computeroutput>.  This
array is assumed to contain one element at index 0.  In order to check
that the element was deserialized as the appropriate element 
(i.e. <emphasis>BlogEntry</emphasis>), we must compare the <computeroutput>any_info</computeroutput> 
field against the reference
to the global variable <computeroutput>BlogEntry_qname</computeroutput> 
declared in <emphasis>BlogEntry.h</emphasis>.
</para>
<para>
Once the type of the element in the response is verified, we can access
the value contained in the <computeroutput>value</computeroutput> field of the <computeroutput>xsd_any</computeroutput>.
<screen>
    blog_entry = *RPResponse->any.elements[i].value;

    printf("BLOG ENTRIES:\n\n%s\n", blog_comments);
</screen>
</para>

<para>
After the value of the resource property has been accessed, we need to
destroy the response instance created by the 
<computeroutput>Blog_GetResourceProperty_epr</computeroutput> function call:
<screen>
wsrp_GetResourcePropertyResponseType_destroy(RPResponse);
</screen>
</para>
<para>
The output of running <computeroutput>get-blog-entries</computeroutput> 
will look something like this:

    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-client-Destroy" xreflabel="Destroy the Resource"><title>Destroy the Resource</title>
<para>In order to destroy the resource we've created after all our invocations
to it are complete, we use the <computeroutput>Destroy</computeroutput> operation defined
in WS-ResourceLifetime schema and inherited by the Blog portType.  The
    <ulink url="destroy_blog.c">destroy_blog.c</ulink> client is an example of using
this operation for the blog resource.  The example imports the resource
reference, calls the <computeroutput>Destroy</computeroutput> operation, and then removes
the file that referenced the resource.

<screen>
    wsrl_DestroyType                    Destroy;

As with the previous EndpointReference invocations, the first two
parameters passed to this function are the client handle and the 
endpoint reference to the resource.  In the case of invoking 
the <computeroutput>Destroy</computeroutput> operation, the <computeroutput>Destroy</computeroutput> and
<computeroutput>DestroyResponse</computeroutput> input and output parameters are just
empty structures and don't contain any pertinent information.
Nevertheless, the <computeroutput>DestroyResponse</computeroutput> variable should
be cleaned up after the <computeroutput>Destroy</computeroutput> operation has completed:

    wsrl_DestroyResponse_destroy(DestroyResponse);

    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-Cleanup" xreflabel="Cleanup"><title>Cleanup</title>
<para>Once all the desired invocations have completed for a particular process,
the client handle needs to be destroyed, and the module must be deactivated.
<screen>
    Blog_client_handle_destroy(blog_handle);

    globus_module_deactivate(BLOGSERVICE_MODULE);

These calls exist in each of the client examples.

<section id="cwscore-tutorial-client-Step3" xreflabel="Step 3: Build the Client"><title>Step 3: Build the Client</title>
<para>Now you've written an end-to-end C WS-Core WSRF-enabled client.  In order
to compile the client we demonstrate how to write a Makefile for it.
First, the following command must be run:
<screen>
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/globus-makefile-header \
    --flavor=&lt;flavor&gt; &lt;package&gt; \
    &gt; MyMakefile.include
</screen>
Assuming you compiled the Globus Toolkit with a <computeroutput>gcc32dbg</computeroutput> flavor,
and using the blog client bindings package from this tutorial, the
command would be:
<screen>
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/globus-makefile-header \
    --flavor=gcc32dbg blog_client_bindings \
    &gt; BlogClientMakefile.include
</screen>
The resulting 
    <ulink url="BlogClientMakefile.include">
<computeroutput>BlogClientMakefile.include</computeroutput>
</ulink>
contains include and
olink definitions for our client.  Now we just need to write a Makefile,
using the variables defined in the output of 
the <computeroutput>globus-makefile-header</computeroutput>  command.  We've
    provided a blog client <ulink url="Makefile.example">Makefile</ulink>.
Once your Makefile is written, running <computeroutput>make</computeroutput>
will generate the client executables.  At this
point you're not quite ready to run it.  The client needs to have
a service running somewhere to interact with.  See 
    <olink targetdoc="cwscoreDeveloper" targetptr="cwscore-developer-tutorials-Service"/>
in order to create and run a BlogService that you can invoke
with your new client.
