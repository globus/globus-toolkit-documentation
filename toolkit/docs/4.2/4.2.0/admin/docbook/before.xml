	<para>
		Before you start installing the Globus Toolkit 4.0,
		there are a few things you should consider. The toolkit
		contains many subcomponents, and you may only be
		interested in some of them.
	</para>

	<para>
		There are non-web services implementations of Security,
		GridFTP, Resource Management (GRAM), Replica Location
		Service, and Information Services (MDS2). These all
		run on Unix platforms only.
	</para>

	<para>
		Additionally, there are WSRF implementations of Security,
		Resource Management (GRAM), Reliable File Transfer (RFT),
		and Information Services (Index). All the Java clients
		to these services run on both Windows and Unix. The
		WSRF GRAM service requires infrastructure that only
		runs on Unix systems.

	</para>
	<para>
		Therefore, if you are new to the toolkit and want to
		experiment with all of the components, you may want
		to use a Unix system. If you are interested in the
		Windows development, you may restrict yourself to the
		Java-based software.
