Rendezvous port type
<p>
<h3>Flow of control</h3>
Given a set of tasks (e.g. processes) at the level 0 (leaf) of a hierarchy of 
execution units (e.g. jobs or multijobs) layered in a number of levels 
mapped to a corresponding hierarchy of rendezvous resources, tasks will rendezvous with 
each other using the rendezvous hierarchy.<p>
For each level 1 execution unit (e.g job) or rendezvous:
<ol>
<li>the controlling task (e.g. process 0) subscribes for notifications for when the 
    rendezvous is complete 
    (optimization: this step is not needed if there is only one task)</li>
<li>each task (e.g. process) registers its data to the rendezvous resource of level 1 (e.g. GRAM job)</li>
<li>when/if the controlling task (e.g. process 0) gets a notification 
    of rendezvous completion:<p>
    <b>if</b> there exists a <i>higher-level rendezvous (e.g. multijob)</i>
    <b>then</b> the controlling task (e.g. process 0) makes remote calls to it 
    in order to:
    <ol>
        <li>subscribe for notifications for when that rendezvous is complete</li>
        <li>register the data for the entire set of tasks</li>
    </ol>
</li>
<li>the flow can iterate if there are more rendezvous levels</li>
</ol>

<h3>Data format</h3>

The input format of the binary data to register is recursive:
<ul>
<li>level 0 data :== byteCount SPACE bytes  with byteCount an ASCII encoded byte array</li>
<li>level 1 data :== dataCount SPACE (level 0 data)*</li>
<li>level 2 data :== dataCount SPACE (level 1 data)*</li>
<li>...
</ul>

The "level 0 data" is the data of a task at level 0 of the rendezvous hierarchy 
(e.g. the data for a subjob process).
<p>
The generic form is:
<ul>
<li>level 0 data :== byteCount SPACE bytes</li>
<li>level n data :== dataCount SPACE (level n-1 data)*  with n >=1</li>
</ul>

The level n data with n >=1 is the aggregation of all the registered data sets 
of level n-1 (for instance in a GRAM job, level 1 is the level of the job and 
its data is the aggregation, according to the format defined above, of all the 
data sets for every processes started by the job).
<p>
The format of the data shipped within a notification of rendezvous completion 
is the "level n data" with n >= 1 (e.g. the aggregated data at level n).
<p>
Example:
<ul>
<li> process data :== byteCount SPACE bytes</li>
<li>  subjob data :== processCount SPACE (process data)*</li>
<li>multijob data :== subjobCount SPACE (subjob data)*</li>
<li>...
</ul>
<p>
<h2><a name="#implementing"></a>Implementing Rendezvous clients</h2>
Implementing a Rendezvous client (for instance a program executed as a 
computational job via GRAM and that needs to use GRAM built-in Rendezvous capabilities) 
implies the coding of remote calls from the client to the Rendezvous service/resource 
pairs via local calls to stubs generated by the tooling. Two kinds of calls must be 
performed:
<ol>
<li>subscribe to the rendezvous for notifications:</li>
<li>register data with the rendezvous:</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="#gram"></a>Integration with GRAM</h2>

<h3>Writing job applications hat use the Rendezvous features</h3>

GRAM creates a rendezvous resource for every managed job. 
In fact, the current implementation merges the rendezvous 
resource and the GRAM job resource. The job application 
can therefore use the contact information for the GRAM job 
Web service in order to perform remote rendezvous registration. 
There is no separate service-resource pair to talk to.
<p>
There are several environment variables that the job process 
can access in order to obtain information about the job structure 
and the GRAM job service-resource remote references:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>$GLOBUS_GRAM_JOB_HANDLE</b>: this is the handle to the 
   service-resource pair of the GRAM job that started the process 
   accessing the environment variable. 
</li>
<li><b>$GLOBUS_GRAM_MULTIJOB_HANDLE</b>: this is the handle to the 
   GRAM multijob service-resource pair, if the GRAM job was defined 
   as is being executed as part of a multijob. 
</li>
<li><b>$GLOBUS_GRAM_SUBJOB_RANK</b>: this is the rank of the GRAM job 
   as a subjob within the multijob. This corresponds to the order of 
   the subjob in the multijob description submitted to GRAM. The value is 
   an integer between 0 and <i>n-1</i> where <i>n</i> is the number of 
   subjobs in the multijob (with <i>n</i> greater or equal to 1).
</li>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Note:</b> a "handle" is a scalar version 
   of an endpoint reference, containing only the URL of the service 
   and the resource ID of the resource. The format of a handle is as such:<p>
   handle :== serviceURL ? resource ID

<h3>Application to MPI jobs</h3>

Acquisition of the contact data for the processes in a job is 
different than the actual interprocess contact, which is always 
done through MPI. Interactions depend on the usage of native MPI or 
non-native MPI. There are two cases:<p>
<ul>
<li>
non-native MPI: process 0 uses the GRAM Rendezvous feature in order to 
do interprocess data exchange, i.e acquiring processes contact data. </li>
<li>
native MPI: process 0 gets all siblings contact through native MPI. There 
is no need for a subjob-level rendezvous her. Only a multijob rendezvous 
is used (if there is a multijob).</li>
