<para>
The Globus Toolkit's C WS-Core component provides tools and APIs for creating
web services in C.  It also provides additional support for creating web
services which are WSRF-enabled, meaning the service can manage resources
and the associated resource properties.  This tutorial provides
a walkthrough of the steps needed to create a WSRF-enabled
service in C, from defining a WSDL schema for the service to actually running
the service in the C service container.
</para>
<para>
The service we implement in this tutorial is the BlogService, which
is a simple service that allows new Blog topics to be created as resources,
and then allows comments to be added to a particular Blog topic.  See
the 
<ulink url="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Blog&amp;redirect=no">
Blog Wikipedia entry</ulink>
for more information on Blogs.
</para>
<para>
In our BlogService, the primary resource 
property is the <computeroutput>BlogEntry</computeroutput> element,
which is an array of BlogEntryType instances containing
the comment, author, and timestamp of each entry posted to the Blog topic.  
For the tutorial,
we will demonstrate how to generate the service stubs and skeletons for the
BlogService, and how to provide the service implementation, including creation
of new Blog topics as resources, and adding new blog entries to the 
BlogEntry Resource Property.

For the purposes of this tutorial, we provide the following:

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>WSDL schema files for the BlogService:
<itemizedlist>
    <listitem><simpara><ulink url="../blog.wsdl">blog.wsdl</ulink> - Includes the input/output

A GPT package 
    <ulink url="blog_service_bindings-0.2.tar.gz">

</simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>




This tutorial defines 5 steps needed to create
any WSRF-enabled service using C WS-Core, and then provides example
walkthroughs of those steps with the BlogService.
</para>
</section>

<section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-Step1" xreflabel="Step 1: Acquiring a WSDL Schema"><title>Step 1: Acquiring a WSDL Schema</title>

<para>You must either obtain pre-existing WSDL schema files or write your own.
The schema files must contain a service definition that defines the service.
Please note that the C WS-Core only supports document/literal style WSDL
schema files at present.
</para>
<para>
    For the BlogService, we provide <ulink url="../blog.wsdl">blog.wsdl</ulink> that defines
the factory operation <computeroutput>createBlogTopic</computeroutput> and the append operation
<computeroutput>addEntry</computeroutput>, as well as the <computeroutput>BlogEntry</computeroutput> resource property
for each blog resource.
</para>
</section>

<section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-Step2" xreflabel="Step 2: Generating Service Bindings"><title>Step 2: Generating Service Bindings</title>
<para>Once you have the WSDL schema(s) for the service, you need to generate the
service bindings from that schema.  This will provide the C skeleton functions
for the service implementation.  The command used to generate the bindings is
<computeroutput>globus-wsrf-cgen</computeroutput>.
</para>
<para>
To run this command on the Blog schema files, they must be placed in
<computeroutput>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/schema/tutorials/blog/</computeroutput>, so that the
relative import paths are correct.  The command for generating the blog 
service bindings looks like this:
<screen>
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/globus-wsrf-cgen -no-client -s blog_service \
    -d $PWD/bindings -flavor &lt;flavor&gt; \
    $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/schema/tutorials/blog/blog_service.wsdl
</screen>

This command generates source and header files for the service, and
as a final step, creates a GPT package (a <computeroutput>.tar.gz</computeroutput> file)
that contains all the source, headers and necessary build files.  Building
    this package is described in <olink targetdoc="cwscoreDeveloper" targetptr="cwscore-tutorial-service-Step4" />.  The above command generates build files
and type bindings files in the
bindings directory as a sub-directory of the current directory.  
Service specific files
are output to a sub-directory of bindings
named &lt;service name&gt;  ($PWD/bindings/&lt;servicename&gt;/).  
In this example the sub-directory is
named <computeroutput>BlogService</computeroutput>.  
</para>
<para>
The <computeroutput>-d &lt;dir&gt;</computeroutput> argument
outputs the generated files to <computeroutput>&lt;dir&gt;</computeroutput>.  Use
the <computeroutput>-help</computeroutput> argument to get further info.
</para>
</section>

<section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-Step3" xreflabel="Step 3: Writing the Service implementation"><title>Step 3: Writing the Service implementation</title>
<para>
Once the service binding generation has completed, 
the service skeleton functions will reside
in the &lt;service name&gt;_skeleton.c source file contained
in the &lt;service name&gt; directory.
This is the file with the operation functions 
that must be filled in to complete the implementation of the service.  
For this example, the file we must
modify is <computeroutput>BlogService/BlogService_skeleton.c</computeroutput>. 
This source file includes skeleton functions for each of the operations
    defined in the <ulink url="../blog.wsdl">blog.wsdl</ulink> 
schema file.  

The two
operations that need to be implemented are 
<computeroutput>createBlogTopic</computeroutput> and
<computeroutput>addEntry</computeroutput>.  The associated functions in 
    <ulink url="BlogService_skeleton.c">
BlogService_skeleton.c</ulink> 
are <computeroutput>Blog_createBlogTopic_impl</computeroutput>
and <computeroutput>Blog_addEntry_impl</computeroutput>.  
</para>
    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-Resource" xreflabel="Creating a Resource">
<title>Creating a Resource</title>
<para>
In the WS-ResourceFramework, operations which create 
new resources and provide us with references to 
them are called <emphasis>factories</emphasis>.  In the BlogService, 
the <computeroutput>createBlogTopic</computeroutput> operation is the factory
that creates a new resource (a new Blog topic), and returns
a reference to it (as an EnpointReference).  This function
creates the resource instance, fills in the EndpointReference
to be returned, and creates a resource property <computeroutput>BlogEntry</computeroutput>
on the resource.
</para>
</section>

    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-ResourceID" xreflabel="The Resource ID"><title>The Resource ID</title>
<para>As the first step
of creating a resource in our <computeroutput>Blog_createBlogTopic_impl</computeroutput>
function, we must acquire a resource ID.  The resource ID is an application
specific object that acts as a unique
identifier for the resource within the service, and gets embedded within
the EndpointRerence for the new resource.  For C WS-Core, the
resource ID must be in the form of a string.
In many services, the resource ID is a UUID string, generated by the
<computeroutput>globus_uuid_create</computeroutput> function.  See the
UUID library documentation for further info.
</para>
<para>
In the case of the BlogService,
we assume that no two Blogs created by the same person
will have the same topic, so we can join the author and topic strings 
together as the resource ID for the new resource we are about to
create.
<screen>
globus_result_t
Blog_createBlogTopic_impl(
    globus_service_engine_t             engine,
    globus_soap_message_handle_t        message,
    globus_service_descriptor_t *       descriptor,
    createBlogTopicType * createBlogTopic,
    createBlogTopicResponseType * createBlogTopicResponse,
    const char ** fault_name,
    void ** fault)
{
    char *                              resource_id;
    globus_result_t                     result = GLOBUS_SUCCESS;

    GlobusFuncName(Blog_createBlogTopic_impl);
    BlogServiceDebugEnter();

    blog_id = globus_common_create_string(
        "%s#%s", createBlogTopic->Creator, createBlogTopic->Topic);
</screen>
The <computeroutput>blog_id</computeroutput> is then passed to the
 <computeroutput>globus_resource_create</computeroutput>
function, which will create a managed resource and return it in
<computeroutput>blog_resource</computeroutput>.
<screen>
    result = globus_resource_create(
        blog_id,
        &amp;blog_resource);

    ...

    result = BlogServiceInitResource(blog_id);
</screen>
The second call in the code listing above is
the service's resource init function, which allows the operation
providers to initialize the resource properties of the resource
you've just created.  For example, the WS-ResourceLifetime operation
provider adds <computeroutput>CurrentTime</computeroutput> and <computeroutput>TerminationTime</computeroutput>
resource properties to the resource.
</para>
<para>
The bindings for any service definition will include a 
<computeroutput>&lt;service name&gt;InitResource([resource id]);</computeroutput>
macro which calls the resource initialization functions for
each operation provider the service includes.
</para>

</section>
    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-EndpointReference" xreflabel="The EndpointReference (EPR)"><title>The EndpointReference (EPR)</title>
<para>Once the resource is created the EndpointReference must be created.
The first step is to initialize a reference property of the EPR,
which will contain the resource ID we just created.  The 
reference property is a field in the <computeroutput>wsa_EndpointReferenceType</computeroutput>
type.  Since the property can be anything, it is typed to the XSD wildcard
<computeroutput>xsd_any</computeroutput>,
which we must create an instance of and initialize
to contain the appropriate type and value for the
reference property.
<screen>
    result = xsd_any_init(&amp;reference_property);
    reference_property->any_info = &amp;xsd_string_info;

    ...

    result = xsd_QName_init(reference_property->element);

    ...

    reference_property->element->Namespace = globus_libc_strdup(
        BlogService_service_qname.Namespace);
    reference_property->element->local = globus_libc_strdup("BlogID");

    result = xsd_string_copy_cstr(
        (xsd_string **)&amp;reference_property->value, 
        blog_id);
</screen>
The <computeroutput>xsd_any</computeroutput> type we initialize has 3 important fields.
The <computeroutput>any_info</computeroutput> field contains the type information used
by the marshalling engine to determine how to serialize the reference
property.  In this case the reference property is just a string, so
we set the <computeroutput>any_info</computeroutput> field to the globally defined 
<computeroutput>xsd_string_info</computeroutput> variable.  For more information on
using wildcards in your service implementation, see  
    <olink targetdoc="cwscoreDeveloper" targetptr="cwscore-developer-scenarios"/>.
</para>
<para>
The <computeroutput>element</computeroutput> field in <computeroutput>xsd_any</computeroutput>
is a <emphasis>QName</emphasis> of the element to define for
serializing the type.
In the BlogService case, we set the element to 
<emphasis>http://globus.org/blog#BlogID</emphasis>.  The other field
we need to set in the reference property is the <computeroutput>value</computeroutput>, which 
is a <computeroutput>(void *)</computeroutput>, set to the pointer of the instance of the
resource id (in this case the blog id string).  We use the
<computeroutput>xsd_string_copy_cstr</computeroutput> function to actually copy the
contents of the string to the <computeroutput>value</computeroutput> field.
</para>
<para>
Once the reference property has been initialized, we can create
the EndpointReference.  The 
<computeroutput>globus_wsrf_core_create_endpoint_reference</computeroutput> convenience
function has been provided to create the endpoint reference.
<screen>
    result = globus_wsrf_core_create_endpoint_reference(
        engine,
        BLOGSERVICE_BASE_PATH,
        &amp;reference_property,
        &amp;createBlogTopicResponse->EndpointReference);
</screen>
This call takes the <computeroutput>engine</computeroutput> passed into the
skeleton function, the base path of the URI for the service
(each service has a <computeroutput>&lt;service name&gt;_BASE_PATH</computeroutput>
variable defined), and the reference property we just initialized.
The resulting EndpointReference must be set to the 
<computeroutput>EndpointReference</computeroutput> field in the 
<computeroutput>createBlogTopicResponse</computeroutput> variable passed into the skeleton
function.
</para>

</section>
    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-ResourceProperty" xreflabel="The Resource Property"><title>The Resource Property</title>
<para>As the last step of the <computeroutput>Blog_createBlogTopic_impl</computeroutput>
function, we set the BlogEntry resource property of the resource.
Since the Blog initially doesn't contain any entries, we set the
resource property to an empty array.
We will add new entries to this resource property in the 
<computeroutput>Blog_addEntry_impl</computeroutput> skeleton function.  
<screen>
    result = BlogEntryType_array_init(&amp;blog_entries);

    ...

    result = globus_resource_create_property(
        blog_resource,
        &amp;Blog_BlogEntry_rp_qname, 
        &amp;BlogEntry_array_info,
        blog_entries);
</screen>
The arguments passed to this function are the created resource, the
QName of the resource property (in this case, <emphasis>BlogEntry</emphasis>),
the info variable of the resource property type to create, and 
    the empty blog array instance.  See the <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/api/c-globus-4.2.1/globus_c_wsrf_resource/html/index.html">
        Resource API</ulink> for further documentation. 
</para>
</section>

    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-AddEntry" xreflabel="Add an Entry to the Blog Topic"><title>Add an Entry to the Blog Topic</title>
<para>Once a resource has been created, clients will invoke the <computeroutput>addEntry</computeroutput>
operation to add new entries to the blog.  The implementation
of the <computeroutput>Blog_addEntry_impl</computeroutput> adds the new entry to
the blog topic.
</para>
</section>
    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-AccessResource" xreflabel="Access the Resource"><title>Access the Resource</title>
<para>
The resource is accessed through the EndpointReference contained
in the message.  The utility function 
<computeroutput>globus_wsrf_core_get_resource</computeroutput> is used to access the
resource.  The EndpointReference is accessed through the 
first parameter (<computeroutput>message</computeroutput>) passed to the function.
<screen>
    result = globus_wsrf_core_get_resource(
        message,
        descriptor,
        &amp;blog_resource);
</screen>
Information about how the resource ID is accessed from the EndpointReference
is maintained by the service descriptor, so this gets passed
in as the second parameter (<computeroutput>service</computeroutput>).
</para>
</section>
    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-GetResourceProperty" xreflabel="Get the Resource Property"><title>Get the Resource Property</title>
<para>
Once we have the resource we can access the BlogEntry resource property
using the <computeroutput>globus_resource_get_property</computeroutput> function.  
<screen>    
    result = globus_resource_get_property(
        resource,
        &amp;Blog_BlogEntry_rp_qname,
        (void **)&amp;blog_entries,
        NULL);
</screen>
The first parameter is the blog 
resource we just accessed, the second parameter
is the QName of the BlogEntry resource property.  
<computeroutput>Blog_BlogEntry_rp_qname</computeroutput> is a global variable declared
in <computeroutput>BlogService.h</computeroutput>.  Global QName
variables exist for each resource property in a service.  The third
parameter is the array of blog entries we want to get.  The last
parameter is the type info structure of the resource property we're
accessing.  Since we know the type of the resource property, we
can just set this to <computeroutput>NULL</computeroutput>.
</para>
</section>
    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-AddBlogEntry" xreflabel="Add the Blog Entry"><title>Add the Blog Entry</title>
<para>Now that we have the array of blog entries, we need to add a new
element to the end of it with the values of the entry.  Each array
type generated from an XML schema document has an associated
<computeroutput>_array_push</computeroutput> function, which creates a
new instance of the type and adds it to the end of the array, returning
the new instance.  In this case, we create a new entry at the
end of the array with the <computeroutput>BlogEntryType_array_push</computeroutput>
function.
<screen>
    new_entry = BlogEntryType_array_push(blog_entries);
</screen>
Now we need to fill in this entry with the values passed into
the skeleton function.
<screen>
    tstamp = time(NULL)
    result = xsd_dateTime_copy_contents(
        &amp;new_entry->Timestamp,
        (xsd_dateTime *)localtime(&amp;tstamp));

    ...

    result = xsd_string_copy_contents(
        &amp;new_entry->Author,
        (xsd_string *)&amp;addEntry->Author);

    ...

    result = xsd_string_copy_contents(
        &amp;new_entry->Comment,
        (xsd_string *)&amp;addEntry->Comment);
</screen>
These functions copy the entry's comment and author from
the input parameter to the new entry instance we've created.  The
timestamp of the entry is set to the current local time.  This
completes the addition of a resource property value to the resource
property maintained by the resource instance.
</para>
<para>
The <computeroutput>addEntry</computeroutput> operation expects as the response a list
of the entries in the Blog.  Since this is just the array of blog entries
that we just added to, we can simply copy this array to the response
output parameter:
<screen>
    result = BlogEntryType_array_copy_contents(
        &amp;addEntryResponse->BlogEntries,
        blog_entries);
</screen>
</para>
</section>

    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-Finish" xreflabel="Resource Finish"><title>Resource Finish</title>
<para>As a last step of the <computeroutput>Blog_addEntry_impl</computeroutput> function, we need
to release the blog resource we accessed in the first step.  This allows the
resource management computeroutput to handle locking and reference counting
for the resource.
<screen>
    globus_resource_finish(blog_resource);
</screen>
</para>
</section>

<section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-Other"><title>Other Issues</title>
<para>In this section we describe other parts of implementing the
skeleton functions that might be of interest.
</para>
   </section>
    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-ServiceInit" xreflabel="Service Initialization"><title>Service Initialization</title>
<para>
Besides the skeleton functions defined for each operation in a service,
<computeroutput>BlogService_skeleton.c</computeroutput> also contains functions
for initializing and finalizing the BlogService.  
The <computeroutput>BlogService_init</computeroutput> function should contain any service specific
computeroutput that needs to be run when the service is loaded, and the 
<computeroutput>BlogService_finalize</computeroutput> function should contain computeroutput that needs
to be run when the service is unloaded 
(presumably cleanup from <computeroutput>BlogService_init</computeroutput>).  These
functions most likely can remain empty no-ops, but if for example
you want a service to have 
 persistent resources which exist throughout the lifetime of the
service, they should be created in the service's <computeroutput>init</computeroutput> function
and destroyed in the <computeroutput>finalize</computeroutput> function.
</para>
    </section>

    <section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-Errors" xreflabel="Error Handling"><title>Error Handling</title>
<para>Almost all of the function calls in our BlogService return a 
<computeroutput>globus_result_t</computeroutput> type.  The <computeroutput>globus_result_t</computeroutput>
informs the caller of the success or failure of the function call,
and is used to reference the error object created if an the function
call failed.  The standard practice in the Globus Toolkit for handling
errors is to check the return value of the function:
<screen>
    if(result != GLOBUS_SUCCESS)
</screen>
and if an error occurred, either chain the error or handle the error
at that level (exit the process, print an error message, etc.).  
The skeleton functions we've implemented in this tutorial have a
<computeroutput>globus_result_t</computeroutput> return value, so the skeleton function
needs to create and return error values if and when they occur
within the service implementation.


The bindings generated for a service include macros for each operation
in the service's header file that create <computeroutput>globus_result_t</computeroutput>
error values to be returned by the skeleton function.  For example,
the signatures of the
macros generated for the <computeroutput>addEntry</computeroutput> operation are:
<screen>
globus_result_t
Blog_addEntry_error(const char *);

globus_result_t
Blog_addEntry_chain_error(globus_result_t, const char *);
</screen>

In general, each operation will have an associated error create function
that takes a string and returns a <computeroutput>globus_result_t</computeroutput> error
as well as an 
error function that takes a base error <computeroutput>globus_result_t</computeroutput> and
a string and returns a new <computeroutput>globus_result_t</computeroutput>.
</para>
<para>
The first function macro listed is useful for error cases where the error
is the primary base cause, while the second function is useful when
another globus function has been called and value which is not
equal to <computeroutput>GLOBUS_SUCCESS</computeroutput>.
</para>
 </section>

   <section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-OperationProviders"><title>Operation Providers</title>
<para>For the operations inherited from the WSRF schemas (<emphasis>GetResourceProperty</emphasis>,
<emphasis>Destroy</emphasis>, <emphasis>SetTerminationTime</emphasis>), their implementation 
has already been provided for us.  This is achieved using 
operation providers,
which replace the functions defined in the <computeroutput>BlogService_skeleton.c</computeroutput>
source file with generic pre-defined versions of those functions
when the service is loaded by the container.   Even
though the contents of those functions remain empty in the skeleton source
file, they don't get used, so they can be safely ignored.
</para>  
 </section>

  <section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-Notif"><title>Service-Side Notifications</title>
<para>
<computeroutput>BlogService_skeleton.c</computeroutput> also includes functions for
the <emphasis>Subscribe</emphasis> and <emphasis>GetCurrentMessage</emphasis> operations that 
are part of the
<emphasis>WS-BaseN</emphasis> schema (inherited by the BlogService), but the C WS-Core 
currently doesn't provide
implementations of <emphasis>NotificationProducer</emphasis> or <emphasis>SubscriptionManager</emphasis>
at present, so these skeleton functions can remain empty as well.
</para>

<section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-Step4"><title>Step 4: Building/Installing the Service Package</title>


   <section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-Packaging"><title>Packaging</title>
<para>Once the service implementation is complete, the service package
can be re-packaged (create the tarball) with the 
implemented computeroutput using <computeroutput>make</computeroutput>.  Change the working directory
to the directory the bindings were generated in, and run:
<screen>
make dist
</screen>
This will create (or re-create) the 
<computeroutput>blog_service_bindings-0.2.tar.gz</computeroutput> package in that directory
with the new service implementation.  This package can be distributed
to any machine with a C WS-Core installation and installed there.
</para> 
 </section>

   <section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-Building"><title>Building</title>
<para>To build the package you just created, run the following command:
<screen>
$GPT_LOCATION/sbin/gpt-build blog_service_bindings-0.2.tar.gz &lt;flavor&gt;
</screen>
This will compile the source files for the types and service and
build them into a library module named 
<computeroutput>libblog_service_bindings.so</computeroutput> (the suffix of the library
may differ depending on the platform).  The header files are installed
into <computeroutput>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/include/&lt;flavor&gt;</computeroutput> and the library
is installed in <computeroutput>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/lib/&lt;service base path&gt;</computeroutput>.

<section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-Step5"><title>Step 5: Running the Service Container</title>
<para>
Once the BlogService library module has been installed,
the service container can be run and the BlogService can be invoked,

<section id="cwscore-tutorial-service-Step6"><title>Step 6: Debugging the Service Implementation</title>

<section><title>Adding Debug Statements</title>

<para>
Each service module includes debugging macros that allow the service
developer to print debug statements in a configurable way.  The debug
statements can have different levels of severity, and are controlled by
environment variables.  Debug statements are only printed when the service
module is compiled with a debug flavor (such as gcc32dbg).

Where <computeroutput>LEVEL</computeroutput> is one of:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara>
<computeroutput>&lt;SERVICE&gt;_INFO</computeroutput>
</simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>
<computeroutput>&lt;SERVICE&gt;_DEBUG</computeroutput>
</simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>
<computeroutput>&lt;SERVICE&gt;_TRACE</computeroutput>
</simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>
<computeroutput>&lt;SERVICE&gt;_WARN</computeroutput>
</simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara>
<computeroutput>&lt;SERVICE&gt;_ERROR</computeroutput>
</simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
The <computeroutput>MESSAGE</computeroutput> parameter consists of the
debug message to be printed.  It must contain parentheses () around the
actual message.  Inside the parentheses can be a format string, and a
variable number of arguments (like printf).

For example, in the BlogService's <computeroutput>addEntry</computeroutput>
skeleton implementation (<computeroutput>Blog_addEntry_impl</computeroutput>), 
the developer may want to see the entry to be added for debugging purposes.
The following statement would print the debug message if the DEBUG level
was turned on:
<screen>
BlogServiceDebugPrintf(BLOGSERVICE_DEBUG,
                       ("ADD ENTRY:\n\tCOMMENT: %s\n\tAUTHOR: %s\n",
                        addEntry->Comment,
                        addEntry->Author));
</screen>

<section><title>Setting Debug Environment Variables</title>
<para>
In order for debug statements to be printed to the terminal, the
user must set the appropriate environment variable before running the
service container.  Each service has a separate debug environment variable
that can be set to different debug levels.  Optionally, the value of the
variable can include a filename to write the debug output to as well.
</para><para>
The environment variable to set for service debugging
is:</para>
<screen>
&lt;SERVICE&gt;_DEBUG=&lt;DEBUG LEVEL&gt;
</screen>
<para>
This environment variable has five disjoint debug levels that can
be set, and match the level definitions used for the debug statement
in the previous section.  The five levels are:</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara><computeroutput>INFO</computeroutput> - general information useful
to users of the service.
</simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara><computeroutput>DEBUG</computeroutput> - debug output used by the
service skeleton implementor to verify code works.
</simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara><computeroutput>TRACE</computeroutput> - output the entry and exit
points of each of the service skeleton functions.
</simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara><computeroutput>WARN</computeroutput> - warn the user that something
bad may be happening.
</simpara></listitem>
<listitem><simpara><computeroutput>ERROR</computeroutput> - output an error for the user
to see as it gets returned.
</simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>There is also a <computeroutput>ALL</computeroutput> level that will
show the debug output for all the levels.
</para><para>
For our BlogService example, if we wanted to see the debug statements at the DEBUG level, then in bash we would set:</para>
<screen>
export BLOGSERVICE_DEBUG=DEBUG
</screen>
<para>If the user wants to see output from multiple debug levels, the levels can
be joined together:
</para><screen>
export BLOGSERVICE_DEBUG="DEBUG|TRACE"
</screen>
