  <title>Configuration overview</title>

  <para>The security settings for Delegation Factory Service and Delegation

Service can be configured by modifying the security descriptors. 

The descriptors allow for configuring  the credentials that will be used by the

services and the type of authentication and message protection required, as well as the authorization mechanism.</para>

  <para>By default, the following configuration is installed:</para>

          <listitem>

            <simpara>Credentials are determined by the container level security descriptor. If there is no container level security descriptor or if it does not specify what credentials to use then default credentials are used.</simpara>

          <listitem>

            <simpara>Authentication and message integrity protection is enforced for the <function>requestSecurityToken</function> operation. Other operations do not require authentication. This means that you may use any of GSI <glossterm baseform="transport-level security">Transport</glossterm>, GSI Secure Message or GSI Secure Conversation when invoking the <function>requestSecurityToken</function> operation on the delegation factory service.</simpara>

          <listitem>

            <simpara>Access is authorized using the grid map mechanism and no grid map is configured in the service by default. If a grid map is configured in the container level security descriptor, it is used. To configure a <glossterm>grid map file</glossterm> for this service refer to instructions in the next section.</simpara>

            <simpara>Access to resources managed by the Delegation Service is managed using the gridmap mechanism. The gridmap used is resource specific and is populated with the subject of the client that originally created the resource. This implies that only the user who delegated can access (and refresh) the delegated credential.</simpara>

  <note>

    <para>Changing required authentication and authorization

  methods will require corresponding changes to the clients that contact this

  service. </para>

 <para> 

 If the service is configured to use GSI Secure Transport, then container credentials are used for the handshake, irrespective of whether service level credentials are specified.
