<section id="index-cft-whatistesting"><title>What is a "Call
for Community Testing"?</title>
<para>A Call for Community Testing is a mechanism to notify our users
that new Globus code is available for testing in the field. Through
these calls, the Globus Alliance hopes to expose its code to a wide
variety of usage scenarios early in its development process. The
ultimate goals are to catch bugs that have historically been found
only after final releases, and to elicit feedback from the
community on ways our software can be improved.</para>

Index Service</title>
<para>Many interesting/hard-to-diagnose bugs previously found in MDS
components have been discovered in large-scale wide-area testing in
the presence of unexpected failure conditions (for example, network
failures or resource failure). Such conditions are difficult to
recreate in a restricted testing environment.</para>
