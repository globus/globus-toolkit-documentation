<h1><a name=GTDocs"></a>Status and Plans for GT4 Documentation:<br>A map of the docs in support of GT4 Final</h1>
<p><font color="gray"><strong>Draft:</strong> 29 October 2004</font></p>

<p>This document is an attempt to describe the body of documentation planned in support of the GT 4.0 release by the Globus Alliance.  The purpose of making this public is twofold:
<ol>
<li>To invite comments on our plans
<li>To expose opportunities for contributing to the GT document effort
</ol>

<p>The document map is comprised of the following sections, each of which covers different areas of the Globus Toolkit:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="docmap_general.html">General GT docs</a>
<li><a href="docmap_security.html">Security docs</a>
<li><a href="docmap_data.html">Data Management docs</a>
<li><a href="docmap_execution.html">Execution Management docs</a>
<li><a href="docmap_info.html">Information Services docs</a>
<li><a href="docmap_common.html">Common Runtime Component docs</a>
</ul>

<h2>We welcome your feedback!</h2>
<p>The feedback mechanism for documentation is based on the Globus Bugzilla System.  If you wish to offer a suggestion regarding our documentation plans (or contribute content!) please create a new <a href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/enter_bug.cgi?product=Documentation&version=unspecified&component=General&rep_platform=All&op_sys=All&priority=P3&bug_severity=normal&bug_status=NEW&cc=&project=Other&short_desc=&comment=&maketemplate=Remember+values+as+bookmarkable+template&form_name=enter_bug">bugzilla entry</a>.  Please ensure that all documentation entries have a Product name of "Documentation" and are assigned one of the following Components:  General, Security, Data Management, Information Services or Common Runtime Components.  Feedback regarding the docmap itself can be filed under Documentation/General.</p>

<p>Please note that most documents in the map have a template associated with them.  A single template can define the structure for multiple documents, and so changes to them can imply great deal of work.  Because of this, early feedback on document templates is appreciated.</p>

<p>Consider joining a discussion list called <strong>gt-dev@globus.org</strong> to exchange ideas about GT4 development activities such as documentation and testing.
