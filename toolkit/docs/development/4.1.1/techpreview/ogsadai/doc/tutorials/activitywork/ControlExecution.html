<h1>Controlling Activity Execution Within the Engine</h1>
<p>
In some cases an activity implementer may wish to have a greater
degree of control over the execution of an activity. There is
an extension mechanism in place through which an activity can install
a custom handler to manage its execution or custom pipes for output
if less total control is required. The extension mechanism is the <span
class="java">configureContext(Context)</span> method provided by the
<span class="java">uk.org.ogsadai.engine.Activity</span>
base class. This method is called 
after object construction, but before the call to <span
class="java">setContext</span>, to permit an activity to modify the
context prior to execution thereby allowing
it to govern almost any aspect of its execution. A note of caution is
required however - the context should be
treated as write-only at this point due to the fact that its state
cannot be guaranteed, and so could differ between two consecutive
executions.  
</p>
 
<h2 id="CustomOutputPipe">Custom Output Pipes</h2>
<p>
Installing a custom output pipe for an activity is done as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
An instance of the desired pipe type must be created. The pipe's
constructor will probably require an <span
class="java">uk.org.ogsadai.engine.ActivityHandler</span>
so that it can initiate processing when a block is requested. For
example: 
<pre class="java">
mOutput = 
  new CachePipe((ActivityHandler)context.get(EngineImpl.HANDLERS + 
  toString()));
</pre>
</li>
<li>
The pipe instance must then be entered into the following section of
the context: 
<pre class="java">
context.put(EngineImpl.PIPES + mOutputs[0], mOutput);
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
That is all that is necessary to install a custom pipe.
</p>
 
<h2>RunAhead Activities</h2>
<p>
To make the engine assign a <span
class="java">RunAheadHandler</span>, the activity must convince
the engine that it is an output activity. This can be done as follows:  
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Do <span class="important">not</span> publish any outputs - this will
make the engine think the activity is an output activity 
</li>
<li>
Use the method described <a href="#CustomOutputPipe">above</a> 
to add the necessary outputs to the context but with the additional line:
<pre class="java">
context.put(EngineImpl.SYNCHRONOUS + mOutputs[0], mOutput);
</pre>
<p>
This line should normally be used when using a <span
class="java">RunAheadHandler</span> in this way because the output 
isn't processed by the <span
class="java">uk.org.ogsadai.engine.ActivityHandler</span>
base class. Without it the engine will not attach a <span
class="xml">deliverToResponse</span> activity to the output if it is 
not used elsewhere in the request. 
</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2>Custom Activity Handlers</h2>
<p>
Installing a custom handler follows the same pattern as other
customizations. During the <span class="java">configureContext</span>
method the following should be done: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>
An instance of the handler to use should be created.
</li>
<li>
The handler should register itself as the handler for the activity
during creation.
</li>
<li>
If custom pipes are required they should be added as <a
href="#CustomOutputPipe">described</a>.
</li> 
</ol>
 <p>
<span class="important">Warning</span>: when using non-threaded custom
handlers for activities that do not publish any outputs you must be
extremely careful that the <span class="java">processBlock</span>
method will not block indefinitely while waiting on consumption of a
block. This case is rare and will only occur when using a buffer
output pipe that blocks on a call to <span class="java">put</span>
when the buffer is full. In this case it is possible that the 
engine will not have initiated the activity that should be consuming from the 
pipe and the request could hang.
