    <td>Proxy file specification in security descriptors is now contained within the &lt;credential&gt; element.</td>

    <td>This change brings in consistency in how credentials are
    specified in security descriptor, since certificate filenames are
    also specified within &lt;credential&gt; element. <a
    href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2535">Bug
    2535</a></td>

    <td>Security descriptors that container &lt;proxy-file&gt;
    element, that were compatible with GT 4.0 will not work
    anymore. The security descriptor files will need to be rewritten
    with this change.</td>

    <td style="text-align: center"> <b>2.</b></td>

    <td>Command line options for clients used for delegation service,
    <i>globus-credential-delegate</i> and
    <i>globus-credential-refresh</i> have been reworked to leverage
    the common client options in Java WS Core client package. Also,
    file name to store delegated EPR has been made a required
    option.</td>

    <td>This makes these tools consistent with the rest of the
    toolkit. <a
    href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=2973">Bug
    2973</a>. Requiring a filename for the EPR eliminates
    inconsistency in how the delegate and refresh clients behave and
    default to. <a
    href="http://bugzilla.globus.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=3077">Bug
    3077</a></td>

    <td> Options that were used for old clients will not work anymore. </td>

    <td> Code committed to trunk</td>
</tr>

<tr style="text-align: left">
    <td style="text-align: center"> <b>3.</b></td>

    <td>Security descriptors have been changed to be schema compliant
    and validation is done during parsing. This also led to API
    changes in the security.descriptor package, which has also been
    reworked, with some API change.</td>

    <td><para>Schema compliance allows for validating of the
    descriptors against a schema using a tool prior to parsing. This
    lends to early and better error reporting.</para><para> The
    descriptor package had multiple classes with functionality
    overlap. Reworking it helped clean up the package.</td>

    <td>Security descriptors need to be rewritten and some changes
    will be needed in code that programatically creates descriptors
    </td>

    <td>Code committed to trunk</td>
