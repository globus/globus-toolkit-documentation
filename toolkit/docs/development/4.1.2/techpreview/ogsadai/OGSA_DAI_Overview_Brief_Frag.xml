<para>OGSA-DAI provides a pure Java data service framework for accessing and integrating data resources - 
    such as files, relational and XML databases - on to Grids. Towards this end, OGSA-DAI:</para>

 
<itemizedlist>
    <listitem>Exposes intrinsic data resource capabilities - such as the ability to perform SQL queries on relational resources or evaluate XPath statements on XML collections - through web service based interfaces, thus allowing data resources to be easily incorporated as first class citizens in grids.</listitem>
 <listitem>Allows additional functionality to be implemented at the service - such as transformation of data coming out of a data resource - so as to avoid unnecessary data movement.</listitem>
 <listitem>Provides a compact way of handling multiple potential interactions with a service within a single request via an XML document, called a perform document, where data is pipelined between different set of activities that operate on a data stream coming out of, or going into, a data resource.</listitem>
 <listitem>Allows developers to easily add or extend functionality within OGSA-DAI. The perform document, and underlying framework, are extensible allowing additional functionality to be added, or existing functionality to be customised, and still operate within the same framework.</listitem>
 <listitem>Allows metadata about data and the data resources in which it is found to be queried via a service interface.</listitem>
 <listitem>Facilitates the provision of data integration capabilities from various sources to obtain the required information.</listitem>

<para> This WS-RF distribution of OGSA-DAI has been designed to work with the Globus Toolkit 4 implementation of WS-RF; 
 a WS-I distribution is also available from the OGSA-DAI web site, which is designed to work with the UK OMII web 
 services infrastructure releases. Finally, an OGSI-based distribution of OGSA-DAI, designed to work with the GT3.2 
 releases, is also available from the project web site. Note: these releases are not designed to inter-operate. More 
 information about these and OGSA-DAI in general is available from the project website at <ulink url="http://www.ogsadai.org.uk">http://www.ogsadai.org.uk</ulink>.</para>
