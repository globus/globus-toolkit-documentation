<h1>OGSA-DAI Architecture</h1>
<p>
A high-level schematically representation of the OGSA-DAI architecture is shown
in the diagram below. This is an end goal and all the components may not yet be
available within one of the OGSA-DAI distributions. When you 
download an OGSA-DAI distribution you will only get components specific to one of the
WS-I, WS-RF or OGSI infrastructures.

OGSA-DAI High-level Architecture
</p>
</div>
<p>
The different components in this diagram are explained below, working from
the bottom of the diagram up to the top.
</p>
<h2 id="DataLayer">Data Layer</h2>
<p>
The data layer consists of data resources which can be exposed via OGSA-DAI.
Currently these include:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Relational e.g. MySQL, SQL Server, DB2, Oracle.
</li>
<li>
XML e.g. Xindice.
</li>
<li>
Files e.g. files and directories, BinX (Binary XML) files.
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="DataLayerBusinessInterface">Data Layer-Business Logic Layer
Interface</h2>
<p>
This interface communicates information between the business logic and
data layers. This interface is provided by OGSA-DAI classes which
invoke JDBC drivers, XMLDB drivers, or other OGSA-DAI classes to
manage communications to and from data resources.
</p>
<h2 id="BusinessLayer">Business Logic Layer</h2>
<p>
This layer encapsulates the core functionality of OGSA-DAI. This layer
consists of components which manage:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Execution of <span class="important">Perform documents</span> which encapsulate
a pipelined sequence of <span class="important">activities</span> which could consist
of queries or updates operating on a data resource and/or data
transformation and/or delivery operations acting on the incoming or outgoing data streams. 
Activities and Perform documents
are described in more detail <a href="../interaction/index.html">later</a>
on in this guide.
</li>
<li>
Preparation of responses to client requests for data resource query,
update, transformation and delivery activities. Responses include
execution status information and can also include data. Responses are in
the form of <span  class="important">Response
documents</span>. Response documents are described in detail <a
href="../interaction/index.html">later</a> in this guide.
</li>
<li>Data transformation and delivery management.</li>
<li>Connection to, management of and interaction with data resources.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The business logic later is termed the <span
class="important">DAI-Core</span>.
</p>
<h2 id="PresentationLayerBusinessInterface">Presentation
Layer-Business Logic Layer Interface</h2>
<p>
This interface communicates information between the presentation and
business logic layers. This interface supports invocation of OGSA-DAI
functionality within the business logic layer in a way that is
independent of any Web or Grid environment i.e. a way that is also
suitable to allow non-Web-enabled clients to access OGSA-DAI
functionality directly. This interface provides the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Components to extract information for the business logic layer from
requests arriving via:
<ul>
<li>OGSA-DAI WS-RF services.</li>
<li>OGSA-DAI WS-I services.</li>
<li>OGSA-DAI OGSI services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
Components to extract information from the business logic layer and
build responses to be provided via:
<ul>
<li>OGSA-DAI WS-RF services.</li>
<li>OGSA-DAI WS-I services.</li>
<li>OGSA-DAI OGSI services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="InfoPresentationBusiness">Information From Presentation Layer
to Business Logic Layer</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Client proxy certificates and credentials in a Web- and
Grid-independent format.
</li>
<li>
Received data.
</li>
<li>
Perform documents from clients.
</li>
<li>
DAI-Core configuration information including data resource drivers,
data resource URIs, database user names and passwords, information on
supported activities and the legal form of Perform documents.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="InfoBusinessPresentation">Information From Business Logic
Layer to Presentation Layer</h3>
<ul>
<li>
Response documents.
</li>
<li>
Data for delivery.
</li>
<li>
Data resource schema.
</li>
<li>
Information on data resource-related activities that can be requested
by the user within Perform documents.
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="PresentationLayer">Presentation Layer</h2>
<p>
This layer encapsulates the functionality relating to exposing
OGSA-DAI to a Grid via Web- or Grid-enabled interfaces. For each
realisation there is associated WSDL and XML Schema describing the
Web- or Grid-enabled interfaces. The following presentation layer
interfaces are supported:
</p>
<ul>
<li>OGSA-DAI OGSI-compliant services based on the Globus Toolkit 3.2.</li>
<li>OGSA-DAI WS-RF-compliant services based on the Globus Toolkit 4.0.</li>
<li>OGSA-DAI WS-I-compliant services based on Apache Axis 1.2.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="Clients">Clients</h2>
<p>
OGSA-DAI can support access by any suitable OGSI-, WS-RF or
WS-I-compliant client, depending on the OGSA-DAI presentation 
layer deployed at the server which the client is trying to
access.
</p>
<p>
OGSA-DAI provides a <span class="important">Client Toolkit</span>
which provides a higher-level of interaction with OGSA-DAI services
than that supported by exchanging Perform and Response documents. This
however is not yet supported by the WS-RF version.
