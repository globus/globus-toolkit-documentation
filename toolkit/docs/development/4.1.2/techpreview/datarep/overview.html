<h2>A Data Replication Service</h2>
<p>
For the Tech Preview of the GT 4.0 release, we provide our implementation 
of a data replication service based in part on the Lightweight Data 
Replicator system developed by Scott Koranda and Brian Moe at the 
University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee.
</p>
<p>
The system uses a pull-based model for data replication. Each storage site
determines which files that exist elsewhere in the Grid need to be
replicated locally and periodically issues requests to pull the data to the
local site. 
</p>
<p>
The determination of which files need to be replicated is outside the scope
of our service. In LDR, this determination is made based on a
search for files that share specified metadata attributes. A variety of
other mechanisms might be used to determine the list of desired files.
</p>
<p>
Our service provides a WS-RF interface that allows a client to specify
the list of files to be pulled to the local site and associates priorities
with these files. The interface also allows clients to remove files from
this list. Internally, a WS-Resource will maintain state about the files
that have been requested. Based on the configuration of the resource, it
will periodically compare the prioritized list of requested files with files
that already exist on local storage. For those files that do not exist
locally, the implementation will consult the RLS's Replica Location Index to
find one or more copies of the file in the Grid environment. Using a random
selection or some replica selection algorithm, our implementation will
select among available replicas for each file being transferred to the local
site. Then it will submit the requests based on their priorities, most
likely using the Reliable File Transfer Service. Once requests are
successfully transferred to the local storage site, they are registered in
the Local Replica Catalog of the RLS. Failed data transfers are retried by
RFT for some period of time; if these transfers also fail, the file remains
on the priority queue, and additional attempts are made to fetch the data.
