  <title>Basic procedure for using GridFTP (globus-url-copy)</title>
  <indexterm role="howto-data"><primary>moving files</primary><secondary>basic procedure</secondary></indexterm>
  <para>If you just want the "rules of thumb" on getting started  (without all the details), the following options using <computeroutput>globus-url-copy</computeroutput> will normally give acceptable performance:
  </para>
  
  <screen>globus-url-copy -vb -tcp-bs 2097152 -p 4 <replaceable>source_url</replaceable> <replaceable>destination_url</replaceable></screen>
  
  <para>The source/destination URLs will normally be one of the following:</para>
  
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem><simpara><replaceable>file:///path/to/my/file</replaceable> if you are accessing a file on a file system accessible by the host on which you are running your <glossterm linkend="client">client</glossterm>.</simpara></listitem>
   <listitem><simpara><replaceable>gsiftp://hostname/path/to/remote/file</replaceable> if you are accessing a file from a GridFTP <glossterm linkend="server">server</glossterm>.</simpara></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <title>Putting files</title>
  <indexterm role="howto-data"><primary>moving files</primary><secondary>from your file system to the server</secondary></indexterm>
  <para>One of the most basic tasks in GridFTP is to "put" files, i.e., moving a file from your file system to the server. 
   So for example, if you want to move the file <filename>/tmp/foo</filename> from a file system 
   accessible to the host on which you are running your client to a file name <filename>/tmp/bar</filename> on a host named 
   <filename>remote.machine.my.edu</filename> running a GridFTP server, you would use 
   this command:</para>
  <screen>globus-url-copy -vb -tcp-bs 2097152 -p 4 file:///tmp/foo gsiftp://remote.machine.my.edu/tmp/bar</screen>
  
<para><note><simpara>In theory, <filename>remote.machine.my.edu</filename> could 
   be the same host as the one on which you are running your client, but that is normally only done in testing situations. </simpara></note></para>

  <indexterm role="howto-data"><primary>moving files</primary><secondary>from a server to your file system</secondary></indexterm>
  <para>A get, i.e, moving a file from a server to your file system, would just reverse the source and 
   destination URLs:</para>
  <para><tip><simpara> Remember <replaceable>file:</replaceable> always refers to your file system.</simpara></tip></para>
  
  <screen>globus-url-copy -vb -tcp-bs 2097152 -p 4 gsiftp://remote.machine.my.edu/tmp/bar file:///tmp/foo</screen></section>

  <indexterm role="howto-data"><primary>moving files</primary><secondary>between two GridFTP servers (a third party transfer)</secondary></indexterm>
  <para>Finally, if you want to move a file between two GridFTP servers (a <glossterm linkend="third-party-transfers">third party transfer</glossterm>), 
   both URLs would use <filename>gsiftp:</filename> as the protocol:</para>
  
  <screen>globus-url-copy -vb -tcp-bs 2097152 -p 4 gsiftp://<replaceable>other.machine.my.edu</replaceable>/tmp/foo gsiftp://<replaceable>remote.machine.my.edu</replaceable>/tmp/bar</screen>

   <para>If you want to access data in a non-POSIX file data source that has a POSIX interface, the standard server will do just fine.  
    Just make sure it is really POSIX-like (out of order writes, contiguous byte writes, etc).</para>
