		<para>In general, Globus tools will look for a configuration file in a

			individuals to override those defaults.

		<title>Configuring Globus to Trust a Particular Certificate Authority</title>

		<para>The Globus tools will trust certificates issued by a CA if (and only if) it
			can find information about that CA in the trusted certificate directory.
			[TODO: link to the environment fragment, which explains where the
			trusted certificates directory is]
			The
			following two files must exist in that directory for each trusted CA:
		</para>
		<table>
			<title>Trusted CA files</title>
			<tgroup cols="2">
				<tbody>
					<row>
						<entry><filename><replaceable>cert_hash</replaceable>.0</filename></entry>
						<entry>The trusted CA certificate.</entry>

			<listitem><simpara>its CA certificate
				exists (with the appropriate name) in the <replaceable>TRUSTED_CA</replaceable> directory,
				and</simpara></listitem>

				the signing policy file.</simpara></listitem>
		</itemizedlist>
		<para>WSRF-based components ignore the signing policy file and will honor
			all valid certificates issued by trusted CAs.
		</para>
		<para>The <replaceable>cert_hash</replaceable> that appears in the file names above is the hash of
			the CA certificate, which can be found by running the command:

		</para>
		<screen>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/bin/openssl x509 -hash -noout &lt; <replaceable>ca_certificate</replaceable></screen>
		<para>Some CAs provide tools to install their CA certificates and signing policy
			files into the trusted certificates directory.  You can, however, create
			a signing policy file by hand; the signing policy file has the following
			format:
		</para>
<screen>
access_id_CA X509 '<replaceable>CA Distinguished Name</replaceable>'
pos_rights globus CA:sign
cond_subjects globus '"<replaceable>Distinguished Name Pattern</replaceable>"'</screen>
		<para>In the above, the <replaceable>CA Distinguished Name</replaceable> is the subject name of the
			CA certificate, and the <replaceable>Distinguished Name Pattern</replaceable> is a string
			used to match the distinguished names of certificates granted by the CA.
			Some very simple wildcard matching is done -- if the
			<replaceable>Distinguished Name Pattern</replaceable> ends with a '*', then any distinguished
			name that matches the part of the CA subject name before the '*' is considered
			a match.  Note:  the cond_subjects line may contain a space-separated list of distinguished name patterns.

		<title>Requesting Service Certificates</title>
		<para>Different CAs use different mechanisms for issuing end-user

		</para>
		<screen>
grid-cert-request -host <replaceable>hostname</replaceable> -service <replaceable>service_name</replaceable></screen>
		<para>where <replaceable>hostname</replaceable> is the fully-qualified name of the host on which

                        In practice this is done by first doing a reverse lookup on the IP

                        the canonical name for the host. Once the service has authenticated to 
                        the client, the client compares the content of the first common name (CN) 
                        component in the service's identity with the canonical hostname obtained 
                        in the first step. For the purpose of comparison the following rules apply:

					If the permissions on your proxy file are too lax (for example, if others

					creating a new one (with <command>grid-proxy-init</command>).  However, it is still
					possible that someone else has made a copy of that file during the time
					that the permissions were wrong.  In that case, they will be able to
					impersonate you until the proxy file expires or your permissions or
					end-user certificate are revoked, whichever happens first.

				<para>
					If the permissions on your end user certificate private key file are too lax

					refuse to create a proxy certificate.  You can "fix" this by changing the
					permissions on the private key file; however, you will still have a much
					more serious problem:  it's possible that someone has made a copy of
					your private key file.  Although this file is encrypted, it is possible
					that someone will be able to decrypt the private key, at which point they
