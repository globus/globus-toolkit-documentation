<section id="s-myproxy-introduction"><title>Introduction</title>
<para> This guide contains advanced configuration information for system
administrators working with MyProxy. It provides references to information
on procedures typically performed by system administrators, including
installation, configuring, deploying, and testing the installation.</para>

<para>A typical MyProxy configuration has one dedicated myproxy-server for
  the site, with MyProxy clients installed on all systems where other
  Globus Toolkit client software is installed. </para>

<para>No additional configuration is required to use MyProxy clients after they
  are installed, although you may want to set the MYPROXY_SERVER environment
  variable to the hostname of your myproxy-server in the default user environment
  on your systems. Information for configuring the myproxy-server is <link linkend="s-myproxy-configserver">here</link>. </para>

<section id="s-myproxy-configserver"><title>Configuring a MyProxy server installation</title>

<para>
You should choose a well-protected host to run the myproxy-server
on. Consult with security-aware personnel at your site. You want a host
that is secured to the level of a Kerberos KDC, that has limited user
access, runs limited services, and is well monitored and maintained in
terms of security patches.
</para>

<para>
For a typical myproxy-server installation, 
the host on which the myproxy-server is running must
have /etc/grid-security created and a host certificate installed.
In this case, the myproxy-server will run as root so it can access the
host certificate and key.
</para>

<para>
Next,
modify $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/myproxy-server.config
to configure the MyProxy server.
<emphasis>If you skip this step, your myproxy-server will not accept
any requests.</emphasis>
The default configuration does not enable any
myproxy-server features to provide the greatest security until you
have configured your server.
To enable all myproxy-server features, uncomment to provided sample
policy at the top of the myproxy-server.config config file, as
follows:
</para>
<screen>
#
# Complete Sample Policy
#
# The following lines define a sample policy that enables all
# myproxy-server features.  See below for more examples.
accepted_credentials  "*"
authorized_retrievers "*"
default_retrievers    "*"
authorized_renewers   "*"
default_renewers      "none"</screen>
<para>
If you have root access, you can copy your
myproxy-server.config file to /etc/myproxy-server.config
so it is not overwritten by later installations.
</para>

</section>
<section id="s-myproxy-deploying"><title>Deploying</title>

<para>
A sample SysV-style
boot script for MyProxy is installed at
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/myproxy/etc.init.d.myproxy.
To install on Linux, copy the file to /etc/rc.d/init.d/myproxy and run
'chkconfig --add myproxy'.
You will need to edit the file to set the GLOBUS_LOCATION environment
variable correctly.
</para>

<para>
Alternatively, to run the myproxy server out of inetd or xinetd, you
need to do the following as root:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara>   Add the entries in
       $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/myproxy/etc.services.modifications to the
       /etc/services or /etc/inet/services file.
       </simpara></listitem>
 
<listitem><simpara>   Add the entries in
       $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/myproxy/etc.inetd.conf.modifications to
       /etc/inetd.conf or /etc/inet/inetd.conf, or copy
       $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/myproxy/etc.xinetd.myproxy to
       /etc/xinetd.d/myproxy.  You'll need to modify the paths in the
       file according to your installation.
       </simpara></listitem>

<listitem><simpara>   Reactivate the inetd (or xinetd).
       This is typically accomplished by sending the SIGHUP signal to
       the daemon.  Refer to the inetd or xinetd man page for your system.
       </simpara></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<section id="s-myproxy-testing"><title>Testing</title>

<para>
To verify your myproxy-server installation and configuration, you can
run the myproxy-server directly from your shell.
If using a host certificate, you will need to run the myproxy-server
as root.
First, make sure your Globus environment is setup in your shell.
Set the GLOBUS_LOCATION environment variable to the location of your
MyProxy installation.  
Then, depending on your shell, run one of the following commands.
</para>
<para>
For csh shells:
</para>
<screen>
source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.csh</screen>
<para>
For sh shells:
</para>
<screen>
. $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh</screen>
<para>
Then, run <command>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/myproxy-server -d</command>.
The <command>-d</command> argument runs the myproxy-server in debug mode.
It will write debugging messages to the terminal and
exit after servicing a single request.
You'll need to start it once for each test request.
In another shell, you can run the MyProxy client programs to test the
server.
</para>

<para>
If run without the <command>-d</command> argument,
the myproxy-server program will start up and background itself.
It accepts connections on TCP port 7512, forking off a separate child
to handle each incoming connection.
It logs information via the syslog service under the daemon facility.
</para>
