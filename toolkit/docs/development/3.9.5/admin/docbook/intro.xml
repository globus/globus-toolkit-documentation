		This admin guide is a first attempt to create a
		DocBook version of the Admin Guide.  It is also available
		as a <ulink url="admin.pdf">PDF</ulink>.
		However, the import into DocBook is not yet complete,
		so some information is only contained in the
		component-specific admin guides.  Any section with
		the word "import" can be found in the component-specific
		documentation.
		The master list of documentation is
		<ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/3.9.5/toc_all.html">here</ulink>.
