<section id="introduction"><title>Introduction</title>
<para>This guide contains advanced configuration information for system administrators
  working with GridFTP. It provides references to information on procedures
  typically performed by system administrators, including installation, configuring,
deploying, and testing the installation. This guide should help you configure
and run the GridFTP server in some standard configurations.</para>
<para>This is a partially-complete docbook translation of

<para>The server should generally be run as root in daemon mode, though it is 
  possible to run it as a user (see below). When run as root you will need to have a 
  host certificate.</para>
<para>Run the server: </para>

<section id="inetd"><title>Running under inetd or xinetd</title>
<para>The -i command line option enables the server to be run under inetd or xinetd.
</para>
<para>See the <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/3.9.5/data/gridftp/GridFTP_Public_Interfaces.html#config">Configuration and
   command line options</ulink> section for example xinetd and inetd configuration
   entries. </para>
</section>
<section id="data_nodes"><title>Remote data-nodes and striped operation</title>
<para>The GridFTP server now supports separate front end (client control connection)
and back end (data node) processes. In addition, a single front end process may
connect to multiple back end data nodes. 
</para>
<para>When multiple back end data nodes are available, the server is said to be 
in a striped configuration, or simply, is a striped server.  In this mode, 
transfers are divided over all available data nodes, thus allowing the 
combined bandwidth of all data nodes to be used.</para>
<para>Note: The connection between the front end and data nodes is referred to as 
the <emphasis>ipc channel</emphasis>.</para>

<para>The ability to use inetd or daemon execution modes applies to both 
front end servers and data nodes, and the same certificate and user requirements
apply.</para>

<para>To start the front end: </para>
<screen>globus-gridftp-server &lt;args&gt; -r &lt;host:port&gt;[,&lt;host:port&gt;,...]</screen>
<para>To start the data-node:</para>
<screen>globus-gridftp-server -p &lt;port&gt; -dn</screen>
<para>The <emphasis>-p &lt;port&gt;</emphasis> option used on the data-node is the port 
  that will be used for ipc connections.  This is the port that you will register
  with the front end server.</para>
<para>  For example:</para>
<screen>machineB&gt; globus-gridftp-server -p 6000 -dn
machineC&gt; globus-gridftp-server -p 7000 -dn
machineA&gt; globus-gridftp-server -p 5000 -r machineB:6000,machineC:7000</screen>
<para>The client would only connect to the front end at 
<replaceable>machineA:5000</replaceable>, for example, using globus-url-copy with the -stripe option:
<screen>globus-url-copy -stripe gsiftp://machineA:5000/file file:///destination
   <emphasis>or</emphasis>
globus-url-copy -stripe gsiftp://machineA:5000/file gsiftp://machineX/destination</screen>
Where machineX may be another striped server or a standard GridFTP server.</para>

<section id="s-gridftp-testing"><title>Testing</title>
<para>If the globus-ftp-client-test package has been installed, our standard
test suite may be run to verify functionality on your platform.  Simply set
up the globus environment, chdir to 
<filename>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/test/globus_ftp_client_test/</filename> and run <command>./TESTS.pl</command></para>

<section id="s-gridftp-troubleshooting"><title>Troubleshooting</title>
<para>If you are having problems using the GridFTP server, you should try these steps:</para>
<para>Verify that the server has started successfully.  The easiest way to do this is to
 telnet to the port on which the server is running.
 </para>
<screen>% telnet localhost 2811
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.
Escape character is '^]'.
220 GridFTP Server localhost.localdomain 0.11 (gcc32dbg, 1098910702-1) ready.</screen>
<para>
If you see anything other than a 220 banner such as that, then the server has not started correctly.
Verify that you have the options you expect.  Try no other options besides -s, -i, or -p (the server defaults
should be fine in most cases).  Verify that there are no configuration files being unexpectedly loaded 
from /etc/grid-security/gridftp.conf or $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/gridftp.conf.  If all else fails and
  you still cannot pass this test, seek help on <ulink url="http://dev.globus.org/wiki/Mailing_Lists">gt-user@globus.org</ulink>.</para>
<para>If the server has started correctly, and your problem is with a security failure or gridmap lookup failure, verify
that you have security configured properly <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/development/3.9.5/security/prewsaa/admin/">here</ulink>.</para>
<para>If the server is running and your client succesfully authenticates, but has a problem
  at some other time during the session, please ask for help on <ulink url="http://dev.globus.org/wiki/Mailing_Lists">gt-user@globus.org</ulink>.</para>
