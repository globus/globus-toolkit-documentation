The meaning of a subscription and the resulting notification stream is

clients.

Add efficient timed-wait RP query interface across all services (core

</td>
<td>

An alternate solution to (17) using what has been referred to in
OGSA/OGSI discussions as "one shot subscriptions".  Instead of
maintaining subscription resources to request asynchronous
notification, an operation request is left "open" so that the
asynchronous response can be issued in the response message. The
recipient can retry on failure and prevent indefinite hanging. Whether
this is more or less efficient or scalable depends on many underlying
container and binding-level details.
