<p>  It is a common misconception that the Globus Toolkit is a monolithic entity.
    This is <em>not</em> true. Each Globus service can be installed and
    used independently. For example, if you just want GridFTP, you can install
    just GridFTP. <em>No</em> additional
    software will be installed. You get just the software needed
for GridFTP, and <em>only</em> what you need for GridFTP.</p>
<p>In addition, for those developing new programs and/or services, you can install
  just the libraries that you need (at this time there are ~120 C libraries). Each library contains information about
  the libraries on which it depends. When a library is installed, a dependency
  tree is built. Only the software in that tree is installed.</p>
<h2><a name="install"></a>1. How To Install Individual Components</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
     Download the Globus installer tarfile from <a href="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/downloads/">www.globus.org/toolkit/downloads/</a>:
       either source or binary.</li>
  <li> Uncompress the installer tarfile.</li>
  <li> Configure and install the desired component(s). E.g., for just GridFTP:<br>
    <br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>./configure</tt><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>make gridftp</tt><br>
<br>
And for both GridFTP and WS-GRAM:<br>
<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>./configure</tt><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <tt>make gridftp wsgram</tt></li>
</ol>
<h2><a name="separate_components"></a>2. Separately Installable Components</h2>
<p>  There is a <a href="admin/install/#gtadmin-makefile">list
  of (some of) the "make targets"</a> (separately installable components) included
  in GT5. 
  The following are some examples:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Services and containers:
      <ul>
        <li><tt>gridftp</tt>: GridFTP data transfer service</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><tt>gsi-myproxy</tt>, <tt>myproxy</tt>: MyProxy service</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><tt>prewsgram</tt>: GRAM5</li>
      </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>prews</tt>: GRAM5 and GridFTP</li>
    </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><tt>rls</tt>: Replica Location Service (RLS)</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Libraries:
      <ul>
        <li><tt>i18n</tt>: Internationalization libraries</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Tests:
      <ul>
        <li><tt>prews-test</tt>: Tests for pre-webservices components</li>
      </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><a name="comments"></a>3. Further Comments</h2>
<p>  The process required in <a href="#install">Step #2</a> requires that you download all Globus software
    just to install a single component. However, once that component is installed,
    you can delete the installer and with it all unwanted components.</p>
<p>We adopt this approach out of convenience, not necessity. Since network transfer
  rates tend to be high these days, we believe that it is more convenient to
  give our users everything in one set and allow them to choose what they want
  rather than have several confusing web pages describing dependency information.</p>
<p>For users who do not want to download the entire toolkit, we do provide the
  tool <tt>make-packages.pl</tt>.&nbsp; This less user-friendly tool downloads
  only the components that have been requested for installation.</p>
<h2><a name="packaging"></a>4. To Learn More About Packaging</h2>
<p>  Details: <a href="admin/install/#gtadmin-packaging">http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/5.0/5.0.2/admin/install/#gtadmin-packaging</a></p>
<h2><a name="security"></a>5. A Related Issue: Globus Security</h2>
<p>  Another misconception is that Globus <em>requires</em> use of public-key-infrastructure
    (PKI)-based credentials.&nbsp; This is also not true in the case of GridFTP:</p>
<ul>
  <li>GridFTP can be run in a mode using standard SSH security credentials.&nbsp; This
    makes installing and configuring a GridFTP server a trivial task.&nbsp; Most
    systems run <tt>sshd</tt> for remote access and therefore have ssh keys already installed
    on their hosts.&nbsp; GridFTP can use these keys for authentication with
    clients. (Details on how to do this will be provided soon.)</li>
  <li>GridFTP can be <a href="/toolkit/docs/5.0/5.0.2/data/gridftp/admin/#gridftp-admin-config-security-userpw">run
      with username/password authentication</a>: not very secure, but easy to
      use. </li>
</ul>
<p>(It should be noted that GSI offers many advantages over  either of these
  alternatives: for example,  the ability to delegate credentials.&nbsp; Obviously
  when not using GSI, GridFTP loses this feature.)</p>
