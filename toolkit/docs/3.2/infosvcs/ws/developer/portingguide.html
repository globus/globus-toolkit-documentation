  &gt;Migrating from Pre-WS to WS: Porting Guide</p>
<h2>Migrating from Pre-WS to WS: Porting Guide </h2>
<p>The Globus&reg; Toolkit Version 3.2 (GT3.2) includes a set of core Service
  Data Providers as well as the capability for you to create your own Service
Data Providers. GT3.2 additionally gives you the capability to port existing
  user-created GT2.x/MDS2.x
  information provider programs into WS Service
  Data Providers, as described in this document. </p>
<p>This document is intended primarily for developers who want to extend the
  Information Services in their GT3.2 configuration by porting existing MDS2 information
  providers.&nbsp; A knowledge of OGSA and Grid concepts, particularly as described
  in <a href="http://www.globus.org/alliance/publications/papers/ogsa.pdf">The Physiology
of the Grid</a>, is presumed. </p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> In order for an Index Service provider to make use
  of the Java APIs in GT3, you must substantially rewrite the provider or
  write a new provider, which is beyond the scope of this document.&nbsp; See <a href="servicedataproviders.html#creatingsdproviders">Creating
Service Data Providers</a>. </p>
<p>This document contains the following sections: </p>

<h2><a name="provideroverview">Provider Overview </a></h2>
<p>The Information Services component of the Globus Toolkit includes a set of
  core Service Data Providers used to generate details about such things as platform
  type, host OS, system load, memory, file systems, CPU count, and other host
  resource information. </p>
<p>The Toolkit also provides the ability for a user to create their own Service
  Data Providers to generate any required data. <br>
</p>
<h3>Pre-WS Information Providers </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>A set of core providers is included with MDS 2.2 and is described in detail
    in <em><a href="../../../../2.4/mds/DefaultGRISProviders.html">MDS 2.2
    Core GRIS Providers </a></em>.&nbsp; While these providers can output host
    information and are available for several platforms, note that the purpose
    of this document is not to describe the porting of core host providers to new
    platforms.&nbsp; In fact, this type of porting in WS is essentially the
    same as in Pre-WS, and the existing documentation (the above document and <em><a href="../../../../2.4/mds/GRIS_createnewcore.html">MDS
    2.2 GRIS: Adding New Information Providers </a></em>) <em></em>should be sufficient
    for that task. </p>
  <p>The purpose of this document is to describe the porting of custom providers
    that output application-specific data. <br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>WS Service Data Providers </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>A set of core providers is also included as part of the WS Information Services
    component and is described in detail in <a href="servicedataproviders.html">Creating
    Service Data Providers</a>.&nbsp; These providers produce host
    information as well as having script and interface utility functions. </p>
  <p>Custom Service Data Providers in GT3.2 can be as simple or as complicated
    as needed.&nbsp; The baseline case requires only that the provider developer create
    a Java class implementing the functions of one interface – SimpleDataProvider – whose
    purpose is to produce XML output as a result of its execution.&nbsp; Refer
    to the above-referenced document for more details. </p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="providercomparison">Comparison of Provider Creation/Operation in
    Pre-WS and WS </a></h2>
<p>Before moving into the specifics of provider porting, let's review the basics
  of creating a custom provider and compare the differences and similarities
  between Pre-WS and WS in doing so. </p>
<p>The basic steps for creating a provider are as follows: </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Decide on the kind of data you will need from the provider program, based
      on the needs or constraints of your application. </p>
  <li>
    <p>Decide on how you want the data to be represented and identified. </p>
  <li>
    <p>Create a program that adheres to the input and output requirements of
      the interface you are using. </p>
  <li>
    <p>Enable the provider program through the appropriate configuration mechanism,
      so it is properly defined and identified for execution. </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>These steps are described in more detail in the following sections, with Pre-WS/WS
differences and similarities indicated. </p>
<h3>Step 1: Determine Data to be Generated </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>As indicated above, almost any kind of data can be generated from your provider
    program, limited only by your intended application and the particular input,
    output, and configuration requirements of the environment (Pre-WS or WS) in which
  the provider will run. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Step 2: Define Format/Representation of Data </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The next step is to decide how you want the data represented and identified. </p>
  <p>In Pre-WS, you need to decide how the data should be represented in the Directory
      Information Tree (DIT).&nbsp; This requires the definition of an LDAP schema
      for the GRIS to accept your data, an OID assignment, and naming conventions
      for the data. </p>
  <p>In WS, you can define an XSD schema and a namespace to represent your provider
    data.&nbsp; Definition of an XSD schema is optional, but recommended.&nbsp; Definition
    of a namespace is required.&nbsp; Refer to the <a href="#porting"><em>Porting
    a Pre-WS User-Created Provider Into WS </em></a>section later in this document
    for more information on defining a schema and a namespace. <br>
  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a name="inputoutput">Step 3: Create a Program That Adheres to Input/Output
    Requirements </a></h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Now, you need to create a program that adheres to the input and output requirements
    of the interface you are using. </p>
  <p>In Pre-WS, your program must be callable by the fork() and exec() facilities
    of the GRIS back end, and must return LDIF objects conforming to the defined
    schema on stdout. </p>
  <p>In WS, you can first create a Pre-WS/MDS-style executable and then use the
    fork() and exec() facilities of the ScriptExecutionProvider (a core WS provider)
      to invoke the program.&nbsp; The ScriptExecutionProvider provides a wrapper
      for your program to generate XML on stdout, conforming to the XSD schema
      if one exists.  </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Step 5: Enable the Provider Program </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Finally, you need to enable the provider program through an appropriate configuration
    mechanism, so it is properly defined and identified for execution. </p>
  <p>In Pre-WS, you need to add an entry for your program to the grid-info-resource-ldif.conf
    file, which defines all active GRIS providers. </p>
  <p>In WS, you will be using the ScriptExecutionProvider to invoke your program,
    as described above.&nbsp; This means that there will need to be an entry in
    the Index Service configuration file, index-service-config.xml, file that references
    the ScriptExecutionProvider.&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
  <p>You will need to perform some additional configuration steps to make the
    provider known to WS Information Services so it can be run for you.&nbsp; These
    steps are described in detail in <a href="../../../../3.0/mds/newsdp.html">Creating
  New WS Service Data Providers</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Example </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>To further illustrate information provider creation and operation in Pre-WS
    and WS, let's use an example that we'll call “Machine Room Temperature Information
    Provider.”&nbsp; The purpose of this provider is to communicate with a digital
    thermometer and return a numerical value in degrees centigrade. </p>
  <p>The essence of this or any provider, then, is that it receives data from
    some external source and then publishes the data in the desired format.&nbsp; This
      means that the main portion of the provider code (no matter what programming
      tools are used to create it) stays the same regardless of whether it is
    used in Pre-WS or WS. </p>
  <p>For use in Pre-WS/MDS, we want the provider to output LDIF, so some code like
    the following could be added, where the current temperature would be substituted
    for $TEMPERATURE : </p>
  <p>dn: mds-temperature-name=machineroom, .... <br>
    mds-temperature-name: machine-room <br>
    mds-temperature-value: $TEMPERATURE <br>
    mds-temperature-units: centigrade <br>
    <br>
    For use in GT3, we want the provider to instead output XML, so some code like
    the following could be added: </p>
  <p>&lt;sensorns:temperature <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sensorns:name="machine-room" <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sensorns:value="$TEMPERATURE" <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sensorns:units="centigrade" <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; xmlns:sensorns="http://www.example.com/sensors" <br>
  /&gt;</p>
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="porting">Porting a Pre-WS User-Created Provider Into WS </a></h2>
<p>Now that we've reviewed the similarities and differences in creating providers
  for use in Pre-WS and WS, we're ready to focus in on the steps for porting a
  Pre-WS user-created provider into WS, which are as follows: </p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Redefine the format and representation of the data. </p>
  <li>
    <p>Rewrite the existing code to output XML instead of LDIF. </p>
  <li>
    <p>Enable the revised provider via the appropriate configuration mechanism. </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>These steps are described in detail in the following sections. </p>
<h3>Step 1: Redefine the Format and Representation of the Data </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>Redefining the format and representation of your data involves three steps,
    as follows: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>a) Choose an XML namespace for the data. <br>
      b) 
      Optionally, write an XSD schema
      for the data. <br>
      c)   
      Register the provider, namespace, and schema if you have
        one. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>These steps are described in detail below. </p>
  <h4>Step 1a: Choose an XML Namespace for the Data </h4>
  <p>As the development of user-created Service Data Providers expands, it becomes
    increasingly important that the providers have unique, nonconflicting XML
    namespaces.&nbsp; Without
    this, the providers may collide with each other.&nbsp; Namespace assignments
    are a requirement of the <a href="http://www.gridforum.org/ogsi-wg/drafts/draft-ggf-ogsi-gridservice-29_2003-04-05.pdf">Open
    Grid Services Infrastructure (OGSI) Specification</a>.&nbsp; </p>
  <p>The declaration of namespaces is described in detail in the World Wide Web
    Consortium document <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml-names/">Namespaces
    in XML</a>. </p>
  <p>XML namespaces are essentially URIs (they don't have to point to a web page)
    designed to provide universally unique names for elements and attributes. This
    allows you to define elements and attributes that can be reused in other schemas
    or instance documents without fear of name collisions. </p>
  <p>For example, consider a namespace defined for the GLUE schema as:&nbsp; http://glue.base.ogsa.globus.org/ce/1.1.&nbsp; The
    Host element can be referenced in this namespace, with the knowledge that
    it is different from the Host element in a different namespace that may have
    been defined elsewhere and may not otherwise be known. </p>
  <h4>Step 1b: Write an XSD Schema for the Data </h4>
  <p>It is not required that you define a schema for the data output by your
    ported provider.&nbsp; However, we do recommend having a schema for the following
    reasons: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can use third-party schema validation tools to check provider output. </li>
    <li>You can use automated language stub generators (like the one that is
      part of Axis in the GT3.2 distribution) to generate code that converts between
          XML and Java classes automatically. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>The schema you write for your ported provider will replace your existing
    MDS2.x schema.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
  <h4>Step 1c: Register the Provider, Namespace, and Schema </h4>
  <p>As a service to Globus Toolkit users, ISI/CGT will keep track of user-created
    Service Data Providers and their namespaces and schemas.&nbsp; This will assist
    the user community in finding existing providers that have functionality in
    which they are interested.&nbsp; To register a provider and related information
  with ISI/CGT, send e-mail to <a href="mailto:benc@isi.edu">benc@isi.edu </a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Step 2: Rewrite the Existing Code </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The next step in the porting process is to replace the existing MDS2.x code
      with new code that outputs XML elements.&nbsp; There are no particular
      constraints on the programming tools you can use to do this. </p>
  <p>If backwards compatibility with MDS2 is desired, you can optionally create
    a single command that will invoke the provider, with separate command-line
    options for XML and LDIF.&nbsp; That way the provider will continue to work
    in Pre-WS and will then work in WS as well.&nbsp; The LDIF option can be removed
  if or when you fully transition to GT3. </p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Step 3: Enable the Revised Provider </h3>
<blockquote>
  <p>The final step in the porting process is to enable your revised provider program
    so that it is properly defined and identified for execution. </p>
  <p>As described in <a href="#inputoutput">Create a Program That Adheres to
        Input/Output Requirements</a> earlier in this document, you can
        use the <code>fork()</code> and <code>exec()</code> facilities of the
        ScriptExecutionProvider (a core WS provider) to invoke the program.&nbsp; The
        ScriptExecutionProvider provides a wrapper for your program to generate
        XML on stdout. </p>
  <p>Since you are using the ScriptExecutionProvider to invoke your program, there
    needs to be an entry in the index-service-config.xml providers file that references
    the ScriptExecutionProvider. </p>
  <p>You will need to perform some additional configuration steps to make the
    provider known to WS Index Services so it can be run for you.&nbsp; These
    steps are described in detail in <a href="servicedataproviders.html">Creating
    Service Data Providers</a>. </p>
