      <h2>&nbsp;<a name="overview">GT3 Security Overview</a></h2>
            <p>The Grid Security Infrastructure (GSI) in the Globus Toolkit version 3 (GT3)
      represents the latest evolution of the Grid Security
      Infrastructure. GSI in GT3 builds off of the functionality present in early GT2
      toolkit releases - X.509 certificates, TLS/SSL for authentication and
      message protection, X.509 Proxy Certificates for delegation and single
      sign-on.
            </p>
            <p>Details of GSI secure can be found in the <a href="#gt3-paper">Security 
      for Grid Services</a> and the
      <a href="http://www-unix.globus.org/security/gt3-security-overview.doc">
      GT3 Security Overview</a> papers. Highlighted improvements of GSI3 are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><i>GSI3-secured Web Services</i>: Access to GT3 services is secured
          using the GSI3 libraries. This includes GSI3 capabilities for
          authentication, authorization, delegation, message integrity and encryption.<br>
        </li>
        <li><i>No privileged services</i>: GT3 represents a redesign of the Globus Toolkit Grid Resource Acquisition and Management (GRAM) service
          with a strong eye towards the least privilege principle. No services
          in GT3 need any elevated privileges (&quot;root&quot; access).
          All privileged code is contained in two small setuid-root programs
          with tightly constrained functionality.<i><br>
          </i></li>
        <li><i>Use of Web Services Security Specifications</i>: GSI3 has
          protocols for authentication and message protection using Web Services
          specifications for securing messages using SOAP (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Signature/">XML-Signature</a>
          and <a href="http://www.w3.org/Encryption/">XML-Encryption</a>) and
          the emerging <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ws/2002/12/ws-secure-conversation/">WS-SecureConversation</a>
          specification for context establishing.<br>
        </li>
        <li><i>Standards-based Approach</i>: GSI3 uses technologies that are
          defined in either existing or proposed standards in the IETF, GGF, W3C
          or Oasis. GSI3 will continue to be based on only public
          standards.<br>
        </li>
        <li><i>Proxy Certificates format.</i> The GT3 GSI libraries support
          Proxy Certificates as specified in the <a href="../standards/index.html#proxy">latest
          IETF/Global Grid Forum draft</a>. This includes support for both
          impersonation and independent proxy certificates and a framework that
          allows for addition of supporting other delegation policies. The GT3
          GSI libraries are also backwards compatible with GT2 proxies, in that
          they will accept GT2 proxies and treat them as GT3 impersonation
          proxies.<br>
        </li>
        <li><i>Enhanced client-side authorization</i>: Services in GT3 have
          credentials that not only indicate the resource name on which they are
          running, but the account in which they are running. This allows
          clients connecting to these services a greater level of assurance that
          they are interacting with an appropriate service.
        </li>
      </ul>
      
      Some things have not changed from GT2 to GT3, for example:
      <ul>
        <li><i>GT2 Credential Compatibility</i>: GT3 uses the same long-term
          user and host/service credentials as GT2. Existing PKIs and
          certificates will continue to work in GT3.<br>
        </li>
        <li><i>Resource Authorization</i>. GT2 used a file known as the grid-mapfile
          to map Grid identities (the distinguished name from a user's X.509
          identity certificate) to a local identity (a Unix account name). A GT3
          installation uses the same grid-mapfile as used by a GT2 installation.
          This will allow GT2-based grids to continue to use their existing
          infrastructure to manage grid-mapfiles.<br>
        </li>
        <li><i>Application Interfaces.</i> The GT3 security library is still
          accessible through the Generic Security Service API (GSSAPI), as
          defined by RFC 2743 with extensions as defined by the Global Grid
          Forum GSS-extensions document.</li>
      </ul>
