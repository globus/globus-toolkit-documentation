<para>MyProxy is built and installed as part of a default GT 4.0 installation. For
  basic installation instructions, see the <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/admin/docbook/">GT
  4.0 System Administrator's Guide</ulink>. No extra installation steps are required
  for this component.</para>

<section id="s-myproxy-admin-installing-myproxy-only"><title>Building and Installing only MyProxy</title>
<para>If you wish to install MyProxy without installing the rest
  of the Globus Toolkit, follow the instructions in the
  <ulink url="http://www.globus.org/toolkit/docs/4.0/admin/docbook/">GT 4.0 System Administrator's Guide</ulink> 
  with the following changes:</para>
  <orderedlist>
  <listitem><para>First, you do not need Ant, a JDK, or a JDBC database to build only MyProxy.</para></listitem>
  <listitem><para>  Second, instead of running "make", run:
<screen>globus$ make gsi-myproxy</screen>
  then:
<screen>globus$ make install</screen>
</para></listitem>
  </orderedlist>
<para>
  This will install the MyProxy client and server programs.
  For client-only installations, simply do not configure or use the installed server.

<para>
A sample SysV-style
boot script for MyProxy is installed at
$GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/myproxy/etc.init.d.myproxy.
To install on Linux, copy the file to /etc/rc.d/init.d/myproxy and run
'chkconfig --add myproxy'.
You will need to edit the file to set the GLOBUS_LOCATION environment
variable correctly.

<para>
Alternatively, to run the myproxy server out of inetd or xinetd, you
need to do the following as root:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><simpara>   Add the entries in
       $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/myproxy/etc.services.modifications to the
       /etc/services or /etc/inet/services file.</simpara></listitem>
 
<listitem><simpara>   Add the entries in
       $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/myproxy/etc.inetd.conf.modifications to
       /etc/inetd.conf or /etc/inet/inetd.conf, or copy
       $GLOBUS_LOCATION/share/myproxy/etc.xinetd.myproxy to
       /etc/xinetd.d/myproxy.  You'll need to modify the paths in the
       file according to your installation.</simpara></listitem>

<listitem><simpara>   Reactivate the inetd (or xinetd).
       This is typically accomplished by sending the SIGHUP signal to
       the daemon.  Refer to the inetd or xinetd man page for your system.</simpara></listitem>

<section id="s-myproxy-admin-testing"><title>Testing</title>

<para>
To verify your myproxy-server installation and configuration, you can
run the myproxy-server directly from your shell.
  If using a <glossterm linkend="host-cert">host certificate</glossterm>, you will need to run the myproxy-server
as root.
First, make sure your Globus environment is setup in your shell.
Set the GLOBUS_LOCATION environment variable to the location of your
MyProxy installation.  
Then, depending on your shell, run one of the following commands.
</para>
<para>
For csh shells:
</para>
<blockquote><para>
<command>source $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.csh</command>
</para></blockquote>
<para>
For sh shells:
</para>
<blockquote><para>
<command>. $GLOBUS_LOCATION/etc/globus-user-env.sh</command>
</para></blockquote>
<para>
Then, run <command>$GLOBUS_LOCATION/sbin/myproxy-server -d</command>.
The <option>-d</option> argument runs the myproxy-server in debug mode.
It will write debugging messages to the terminal and
exit after servicing a single request.
You'll need to start it once for each test request.
In another shell, you can run the MyProxy client programs to test the
server.
</para>

<para>
If run without the <option>-d</option> argument,
the myproxy-server program will start up and background itself.
It accepts connections on TCP port 7512, forking off a separate child
to handle each incoming connection.
It logs information via the syslog service under the daemon facility.
</para>
