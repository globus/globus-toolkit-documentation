<para>The following changes have occurred for Python WS Core:</para>
<itemizedlist>
    <listitem><simpara>Added "defer" attribute to generated client bindings.  If set to "True" method invocations return a twisted deferred instance, else if set to "False" (default) they return an instance representing the response message.  Thus it's easy to switch between asynchronous and synchronous programming paradigms.</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>New resources can be dropped into the service container at runtime as twisted "rpy" scripts.  So resources (eg. CounterService) are added or removed from the service container by simply adding or removing a rpy script (eg. CounterService.rpy).</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>WS-BaseNotification, added support for pausing and resuming subscriptions through the Subscription Manager.</simpara></listitem>
    <listitem><simpara>WS-ResourceProperties operations QueryResourceProperties and GetMultipleResourceProperties are now supported/implemented in generated service stubs.</simpara></listitem>
