<h1>How Activities Work</h1>

<p>
	As we described on the
	<a href="../../interaction/Activities.html">Activities</a> page of
	the background reading section,	activities are the data resource
	manipulation, data transformation and delivery actions that a client
	wants an OGSA-DAI service to perform. Some activities are data
	resource-specific (e.g. relational or XML activities), while
	others are generic (e.g. delivery and data transformation).
</p>

<p>
	The following pages provide detailed explanations of how activities
	are configured and processed within OGSA-DAI. For a less comprehensive
	but more practical guide, we recommend following the
	<a href="../activitywrite/index.html">How to Write a Basic Activity</a>
	and
	<a href="../activityconfig/index.html">How to Write a Configurable Activity</a>
	tutorials instead.
