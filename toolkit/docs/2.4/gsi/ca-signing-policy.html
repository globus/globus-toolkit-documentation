    <h2><a name="Changes"></a>Changes since 1.1.x release</h2>
    <p>In the 1.1.x releases of the Globus Toolkit and the GSI software the signing polices
    for all CAs were stored in a single file <em>ca-signing-policy.conf</em> which resided in
    the <em>certificates</em> directory (under <em>/etc/grid-security/ </em>or in <em>$GLOBUS_DEPLOY/share</em>).</p>
    <p>With the release of version 2.0 of the GSI package the policy for each CA is now
    located in a seperate file named after the hash of the CA name[<a href="#hash footnote">1</a>]
    with the string <em>.signing_policy</em> appended. The contents of this file would be the
    same as what you would have inserted in <em>ca-signing-policy.conf</em> in the 1.1.x
    releases.</p>
    <p>For example, the signing policy for Globus CA is now kept in the file <em>/etc/grid-security/certificates/42864e48.signing_policy</em></p>
    <p>This changes was done so that all the files for a new CA could be installed without
    affecting other files in the <em>certificates</em> directory.</p>
    <p>The file <em>ca-signing-policy.conf</em> is deprecated and no longer used.</p>
      <h2><a name="sharing"></a>Sharing a trusted certificates directory between
      a 1.1.x and 2.0 installation</h2>
      <p>If you want to use a trusted certificates directory for both a 1.1.x
      and a 2.0 Globus or GSI installation, you need to maintain both the <i>ca-signing-policy.conf</i>
      file and the policy files with the filenames based off of the hash of the
      CA name. In this situation <i>ca-signing-policy.conf</i> would be the
      concatenation of all the individual policy files.</p>
      <p>It is possible in this situation to make the individual policy files
      symbolic links to <i>ca-signing-policy.conf</i>.</p>
<p><a name="hash footnote">[1]</a> To generate this hash, run the following command
    (replace <em>ca_cert</em> with the filename of the PEM file containing the CA
    certificate):</p>
    <p>openssl x509 -in <em>ca_cert</em> -hash -noout<br>
